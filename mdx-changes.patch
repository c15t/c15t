+title: Drizzle Adapter
+description: The Drizzle adapter integrates c15t Backend with Drizzle ORM, a lightweight, type-safe SQL query builder with schema declaration.
+---
+## Installation
+
+Install Drizzle ORM and the appropriate database driver:
+
+```bash
+# For PostgreSQL
+npm install drizzle-orm pg @types/pg
+# For MySQL
+npm install drizzle-orm mysql2 @types/mysql2
+# For SQLite
+npm install drizzle-orm better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3
+```
+
+## Configuration
+
+1. Define your schema using Drizzle's schema builder:
+
+```typescript
+// schema.ts
+import { pgTable, uuid, text, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
+
+export const users = pgTable('users', {
+  id: uuid('id').primaryKey().defaultRandom(),
+  name: text('name').notNull(),
+  email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
+  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow()
+});
+```
+
+2. Configure the c15t instance with the Drizzle adapter:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { drizzleAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/drizzle';
+import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
+import { Pool } from 'pg';
+
+// Create a PostgreSQL connection
+const pool = new Pool({
+  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
+});
+
+// Initialize Drizzle with the connection
+const db = drizzle(pool);
+
+// Create the c15t instance
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: drizzleAdapter({
+    client: db,
+    // Optional: Pass your schema for type checking
+    schema: { users }
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+### MySQL Configuration
+
+```typescript
+import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/mysql2';
+import mysql from 'mysql2/promise';
+
+const connection = await mysql.createConnection({
+  host: 'localhost',
+  user: 'root',
+  password: 'password',
+  database: 'c15t'
+});
+
+const db = drizzle(connection);
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: drizzleAdapter({ client: db }),
+});
+```
+
+### SQLite Configuration
+
+```typescript
+import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3';
+import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
+
+const sqlite = new Database('database.db');
+const db = drizzle(sqlite);
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: drizzleAdapter({ client: db }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('users', {
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+});
+
+// Find records
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: { email: 'john@example.com' },
+  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10
+});
+
+// Update a record
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete a record
+await instance.database.delete('users', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+### Transactions
+
+```typescript
+await instance.database.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  const user = await trx.create('users', {
+    name: 'Alice',
+    email: 'alice@example.com'
+  });
+  
+  await trx.create('profiles', {
+    userId: user.id,
+    bio: 'Software engineer'
+  });
+});
+```
+
+### Migrations
+
+Use Drizzle Kit for schema migrations:
+
+```bash
+npm install -D drizzle-kit
+
+# Generate a migration
+npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
+
+# Apply migrations
+npx drizzle-kit push:pg
+```
+
+## Type Safety
+
+The Drizzle adapter provides excellent type safety:
+
+```typescript
+import { users } from './schema';
+import { InferModel } from 'drizzle-orm';
+
+// Infer types from your schema
+type User = InferModel<typeof users>;
+
+// Type-safe operations
+const users = await instance.database.find<User>('users', {
+  where: { email: 'john@example.com' }
+});
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Define schema using Drizzle's builders** - Leverage type safety and schema validation
+- **Use prepared statements** - Drizzle uses prepared statements for all queries
+- **Implement connection pooling** - Configure appropriate pool sizes for production
+- **Use migrations for schema changes** - Manage schema changes with Drizzle Kit
+
+## Limitations
+
+- Some complex queries may require direct Drizzle client usage
+- Table names must match schema definitions

+title: Kysely Adapter
+description: The Kysely adapter provides type-safe SQL query building with support for multiple databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
+---
+## Installation
+
+First, install the Kysely package and the appropriate database driver:
+
+```bash
+# For PostgreSQL
+npm install kysely pg @types/pg
+# For MySQL
+npm install kysely mysql2 @types/mysql2
+# For SQLite
+npm install kysely better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3
+```
+
+## Configuration
+
+Configure the Kysely adapter with your database connection:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { kyselyAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/kysely';
+
+// PostgreSQL configuration
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: kyselyAdapter({
+    dialect: 'postgres',
+    connection: {
+      host: 'localhost',
+      port: 5432,
+      database: 'c15t',
+      user: 'postgres',
+      password: 'password',
+    },
+    // Optional: Enable query logging
+    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
+    // Optional: Connection pooling settings
+    pool: {
+      min: 2,
+      max: 10
+    }
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+### MySQL Configuration
+
+```typescript
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: kyselyAdapter({
+    dialect: 'mysql',
+    connection: {
+      host: 'localhost',
+      port: 3306,
+      database: 'c15t',
+      user: 'root',
+      password: 'password',
+    }
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+### SQLite Configuration
+
+```typescript
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: kyselyAdapter({
+    dialect: 'sqlite',
+    connection: {
+      filename: ':memory:' // or path to file like './database.db'
+    }
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('users', {
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+});
+
+// Find records with complex conditions
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: { 
+    email: { $like: '%@example.com' },
+    createdAt: { $gt: new Date('2023-01-01') }
+  },
+  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10
+});
+
+// Update records
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete records
+await instance.database.delete('users', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+### Transactions
+
+```typescript
+await instance.database.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  // All operations inside this function use the same transaction
+  const user = await trx.create('users', { name: 'Alice' });
+  await trx.create('profiles', { userId: user.id });
+  
+  // Transaction automatically commits unless an error is thrown
+  // If an error is thrown, the transaction is rolled back
+});
+```
+
+## Schema Management
+
+```typescript
+import { sql } from 'kysely';
+
+// Create tables programmatically
+await instance.database.raw(sql`
+  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
+    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
+    name TEXT NOT NULL,
+    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
+    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
+  )
+`);
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Use prepared statements** - Kysely automatically uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
+- **Configure connection pooling** - Set appropriate pool sizes based on your application needs
+- **Implement retry logic** - Add retries for transient database errors
+- **Monitor query performance** - Use the debug option to log slow queries during development
+
+## Limitations
+
+- Schema must be created separately or with raw SQL
+- Complex joins require custom SQL or advanced Kysely usage

+title: Memory Adapter
+description: The Memory adapter stores all data in-memory, making it perfect for development, testing, and prototyping. Data is lost when the application restarts.
+---
+## Installation
+
+The Memory adapter is included in the core package and requires no additional dependencies:
+
+```typescript
+import { memoryAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/memory';
+```
+
+## Configuration
+
+The Memory adapter accepts minimal configuration:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { memoryAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/memory';
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: memoryAdapter({
+    // Optional: Pre-populate with initial data
+    initialData: {
+      users: [
+        { id: '1', name: 'Admin User', email: 'admin@example.com' }
+      ]
+    },
+    // Optional: Set persistence to localStorage in browser environments
+    persistence: 'localStorage'
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('users', {
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+});
+
+// Find records
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: { email: 'john@example.com' }
+});
+
+// Update a record
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete a record
+await instance.database.delete('users', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Use for development only** - The memory adapter is not suitable for production use as data is lost on restart
+- **Test with realistic data volumes** - Pre-populate with a representative data set to test performance
+- **Reset between tests** - Create a new instance for each test to ensure a clean environment
+
+## Limitations
+
+- No persistence across application restarts
+- Not suitable for production environments
+- Limited query capabilities compared to SQL-based adapters
+- No support for complex joins or transactions
+
+## When to Use
+
+- During development and prototyping
+- For automated testing
+- For demos and examples
+- When you need a lightweight, zero-configuration database

+title: Prisma Adapter
+description: The Prisma adapter integrates c15t Backend with Prisma ORM, providing type-safe database access with migration support and automatic schema generation.
+---
+## Installation
+
+First, install Prisma and initialize your project:
+
+```bash
+npm install @prisma/client
+npm install -D prisma
+npx prisma init
+```
+
+## Configuration
+
+1. Define your Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`:
+
+```prisma
+generator client {
+  provider = "prisma-client-js"
+}
+
+datasource db {
+  provider = "postgresql" // or "mysql", "sqlite", etc.
+  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
+}
+
+model User {
+  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
+  name      String
+  email     String   @unique
+  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
+}
+```
+
+2. Generate the Prisma client:
+
+```bash
+npx prisma generate
+```
+
+3. Configure the c15t instance with the Prisma adapter:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { prismaAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/prisma';
+import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
+
+const prisma = new PrismaClient();
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: prismaAdapter({ 
+    client: prisma,
+    // Optional: Configure logging
+    logging: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('User', {
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+});
+
+// Find records
+const users = await instance.database.find('User', {
+  where: { email: 'john@example.com' },
+  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10
+});
+
+// Update a record
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'User',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete a record
+await instance.database.delete('User', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+### Transactions
+
+```typescript
+await instance.database.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  const user = await trx.create('User', { 
+    name: 'Alice',
+    email: 'alice@example.com'
+  });
+  
+  await trx.create('Profile', { 
+    userId: user.id,
+    bio: 'Software engineer'
+  });
+});
+```
+
+### Migrations
+
+Run migrations using the Prisma CLI:
+
+```bash
+# Create a migration
+npx prisma migrate dev --name add-user-model
+
+# Apply migrations in production
+npx prisma migrate deploy
+```
+
+## Type Safety
+
+The Prisma adapter provides type safety when used with TypeScript:
+
+```typescript
+// Define your types to match your Prisma schema
+type User = {
+  id: string;
+  name: string;
+  email: string;
+  createdAt: Date;
+};
+
+// Type-safe operations
+const users = await instance.database.find<User>('User', {
+  where: { email: 'john@example.com' }
+});
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Define schema in Prisma format** - Use Prisma's schema format for auto-generated migration files
+- **Use migrations for schema changes** - Let Prisma handle database schema migrations
+- **Enable query logging in development** - Monitor query performance and debug issues
+- **Consider connection pooling** - Configure connection pools for production performance
+
+## Limitations
+
+- Table names must match Prisma model names
+- Some advanced query features may require direct Prisma client usage

+title: Core Concepts
+description: Detailed explanation of the fundamental concepts and architecture of the c15t Backend package, including instance management, context system, and request handling.
+---
+
+This document covers the fundamental concepts and architecture of the c15t Backend package.
+
+## Instance Management
+
+### Creating an Instance
+
+The c15t instance is the core of the system, managing all components and their interactions:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { memoryAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/memory';
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: memoryAdapter({}),
+  plugins: [],
+  context: {},
+});
+```
+
+For a quick start guide, see [Getting Started](./backend#basic-usage).
+
+### Instance Configuration
+
+The instance configuration includes:
+
+```typescript
+interface C15TOptions {
+  // Base URL for the API
+  baseURL: string;
+  
+  // Database adapter
+  database: DatabaseAdapter;
+  
+  // Optional base path for API routes
+  basePath?: string;
+  
+  // Trusted origins for CORS
+  trustedOrigins?: string[] | ((request: Request) => string[]);
+  
+  // Plugin configurations
+  plugins?: C15TPlugin[];
+  
+  // Additional context data
+  context?: Record<string, unknown>;
+  
+  // Authentication configuration
+  auth?: AuthConfig;
+  
+  // Rate limiting configuration
+  rateLimit?: RateLimitConfig;
+}
+```
+
+Learn more about database adapters in [Database Adapters](./backend/database-adapters).
+
+## Context System
+
+### Context Structure
+
+The context is a shared state that persists throughout the request lifecycle:
+
+```typescript
+interface C15TContext {
+  // Request-specific data
+  request: Request;
+  response?: Response;
+  
+  // Database access
+  database: DatabaseAdapter;
+  
+  // Authentication data
+  auth?: {
+    userId: string;
+    roles: string[];
+    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
+  };
+  
+  // Plugin data
+  plugins: Record<string, PluginData>;
+  
+  // Custom context data
+  [key: string]: unknown;
+}
+```
+
+### Context Extensions
+
+Plugins can extend the context with additional data:
+
+```typescript
+const contextPlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'context-plugin',
+  name: 'Context Plugin',
+  type: 'core',
+  init: () => ({
+    context: {
+      customData: {
+        timestamp: Date.now(),
+        requestId: generateId(),
+      },
+    },
+  }),
+};
+```

+title: Database Adapters
+description: Comprehensive guide to the database adapter system in c15t Backend, covering available adapters, query interface, and performance considerations.
+---
+
+The c15t Backend package provides a flexible database adapter system that allows you to use different database backends while maintaining a consistent interface.
+
+## Overview
+
+Database adapters provide a standardized way to interact with different database systems. Each adapter implements the `DatabaseAdapter` interface:
+
+```typescript
+interface DatabaseAdapter {
+  create: <T extends Record<string, unknown>>(table: string, data: T) => Promise<T>;
+  find: <T extends Record<string, unknown>>(table: string, query: Query) => Promise<T[]>;
+  update: <T extends Record<string, unknown>>(table: string, query: Query, data: Partial<T>) => Promise<T>;
+  delete: (table: string, query: Query) => Promise<void>;
+}
+```
+
+## Available Adapters
+
+### Memory Adapter
+
+The memory adapter is perfect for development and testing. It stores data in memory and is reset when the application restarts.
+
+```typescript
+import { memoryAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/memory';
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: memoryAdapter({}),
+});
+```
+
+#### Features
+- In-memory storage
+- No persistence
+- Fast for development
+- Automatic cleanup
+
+### Kysely Adapter
+
+The Kysely adapter provides type-safe SQL query building with support for multiple databases.
+
+```typescript
+import { kyselyAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/kysely';
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: kyselyAdapter({
+    dialect: 'postgres',
+    connection: {
+      host: 'localhost',
+      port: 5432,
+      database: 'c15t',
+      user: 'postgres',
+      password: 'password',
+    },
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+#### Supported Databases
+- PostgreSQL
+- MySQL
+- SQLite
+- Microsoft SQL Server
+
+#### Features
+- Type-safe queries
+- Query building
+- Transaction support
+- Connection pooling
+
+### Prisma Adapter
+
+The Prisma adapter integrates with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access.
+
+```typescript
+import { prismaAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/prisma';
+import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
+
+const prisma = new PrismaClient();
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: prismaAdapter({ client: prisma }),
+});
+```
+
+#### Features
+- Prisma ORM integration
+- Type safety
+- Schema management
+- Migration support
+
+### Drizzle Adapter
+
+The Drizzle adapter provides integration with Drizzle ORM.
+
+```typescript
+import { drizzleAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/drizzle';
+import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/node-postgres';
+import { Pool } from 'pg';
+
+const pool = new Pool({
+  connectionString: 'postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/c15t',
+});
+
+const db = drizzle(pool);
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: drizzleAdapter({ client: db }),
+});
+```
+
+#### Features
+- Drizzle ORM integration
+- Type safety
+- Schema management
+- Query building
+
+## Creating Custom Adapters
+
+You can create custom adapters by implementing the `DatabaseAdapter` interface:
+
+```typescript
+class CustomAdapter implements DatabaseAdapter {
+  async create<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
+    table: string,
+    data: T
+  ): Promise<T> {
+    // Implementation
+  }
+
+  async find<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
+    table: string,
+    query: Query
+  ): Promise<T[]> {
+    // Implementation
+  }
+
+  async update<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
+    table: string,
+    query: Query,
+    data: Partial<T>
+  ): Promise<T> {
+    // Implementation
+  }
+
+  async delete(table: string, query: Query): Promise<void> {
+    // Implementation
+  }
+}
+```
+
+## Query Interface
+
+The query interface is consistent across all adapters:
+
+```typescript
+interface Query {
+  where?: Record<string, unknown>;
+  orderBy?: Record<string, 'asc' | 'desc'>;
+  limit?: number;
+  offset?: number;
+  include?: Record<string, boolean>;
+}
+```
+
+### Example Queries
+
+```typescript
+// Find with conditions
+const users = await adapter.find('users', {
+  where: { active: true },
+  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10,
+});
+
+// Update with conditions
+const updated = await adapter.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: '123' } },
+  { name: 'New Name' }
+);
+
+// Delete with conditions
+await adapter.delete('users', { where: { id: '123' } });
+```
+
+## Transaction Support
+
+Some adapters support transactions:
+
+```typescript
+// Kysely adapter example
+const result = await adapter.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  await trx.create('users', { name: 'John' });
+  await trx.create('profiles', { userId: '123' });
+  return 'success';
+});
+```
+
+## Error Handling
+
+Adapters handle errors consistently:
+
+```typescript
+try {
+  const result = await adapter.create('users', data);
+} catch (error) {
+  if (error instanceof DatabaseError) {
+    // Handle database-specific errors
+  } else {
+    // Handle other errors
+  }
+}
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+1. **Connection Management**
+   ```typescript
+   // Create a single connection pool
+   const pool = new Pool({
+     max: 20, // Maximum number of connections
+     idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
+   });
+   ```
+
+2. **Error Handling**
+   ```typescript
+   const adapter = kyselyAdapter({
+     dialect: 'postgres',
+     connection: {
+       // ... connection config
+     },
+     onError: (error) => {
+       // Log errors
+       console.error('Database error:', error);
+     },
+   });
+   ```
+
+3. **Query Optimization**
+   ```typescript
+   // Use indexes
+   await adapter.create('users', {
+     email: 'user@example.com',
+     // Add indexed fields
+   });
+
+   // Use appropriate query conditions
+   const users = await adapter.find('users', {
+     where: { email: { $like: '%@example.com' } },
+     limit: 100,
+   });
+   ```
+
+## Migration Support
+
+Adapters that support migrations provide methods for managing database schema:
+
+```typescript
+// Kysely adapter example
+const migrations = await adapter.getMigrations();
+await adapter.runMigrations(migrations);
+```
+
+## Performance Considerations
+
+1. **Connection Pooling**
+   - Configure appropriate pool size
+   - Monitor connection usage
+   - Handle connection errors
+
+2. **Query Optimization**
+   - Use indexes
+   - Limit result sets
+   - Optimize join operations
+
+3. **Caching**
+   - Implement caching where appropriate
+   - Use appropriate cache invalidation
+   - Monitor cache hit rates
+
+## Security
+
+1. **Input Validation**
+   ```typescript
+   // Validate input before database operations
+   const validatedData = validateUserInput(data);
+   await adapter.create('users', validatedData);
+   ```
+
+2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
+   - Use parameterized queries
+   - Validate input
+   - Escape special characters
+
+3. **Access Control**
+   - Implement row-level security
+   - Use appropriate database roles
+   - Monitor access patterns
+
+## Monitoring and Debugging
+
+1. **Query Logging**
+   ```typescript
+   const adapter = kyselyAdapter({
+     dialect: 'postgres',
+     connection: {
+       // ... connection config
+     },
+     debug: true, // Enable query logging
+   });
+   ```
+
+2. **Performance Monitoring**
+   - Track query execution time
+   - Monitor connection pool usage
+   - Log slow queries
+
+3. **Error Tracking**
+   - Log database errors
+   - Track failed queries
+   - Monitor connection issues

+    
+    // Use MySQL 8+ features (default: true)
+    useModernFeatures: true,
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Schema Management
+
+Initialize your database schema:
+
+```typescript
+const createSchema = async (db) => {
+  await db.raw(`
+    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
+      id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
+      name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
+      email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
+      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
+    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
+    
+    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consents (
+      id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
+      user_id CHAR(36) NOT NULL,
+      purpose VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
+      granted BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
+      timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
+      metadata JSON,
+      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
+    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
+    
+    CREATE INDEX idx_consents_user_id ON consents(user_id);
+    CREATE INDEX idx_consents_purpose ON consents(purpose);
+  `);
+};
+
+// Use in initialization
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: mysqlAdapter({
+    connection: {
+      host: 'localhost',
+      port: 3306,
+      database: 'c15t',
+      user: 'root',
+      password: 'password',
+    },
+    onInit: createSchema,
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('users', {
+  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+});
+
+// Find records
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: { email: { $like: '%@example.com' } },
+  orderBy: { created_at: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10,
+  offset: 20
+});
+
+// Update a record
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete a record
+await instance.database.delete('users', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+### Transactions
+
+```typescript
+await instance.database.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  // All operations in this function use the same transaction
+  const user = await trx.create('users', {
+    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
+    name: 'Alice Johnson',
+    email: 'alice@example.com'
+  });
+  
+  await trx.create('consents', {
+    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
+    user_id: user.id,
+    purpose: 'marketing',
+    granted: true,
+    metadata: JSON.stringify({ source: 'website', campaign: 'summer2023' })
+  });
+  
+  // Transaction automatically commits unless an error is thrown
+});
+```
+
+### Advanced Queries
+
+```typescript
+// JSON filtering (MySQL 8+)
+const users = await instance.database.find('consents', {
+  where: {
+    $raw: "JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.source') = ?",
+    $params: ['website']
+  }
+});
+
+// Raw SQL for complex queries
+const stats = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT 
+    purpose, 
+    COUNT(*) as total_count,
+    SUM(IF(granted, 1, 0)) as granted_count
+  FROM consents
+  GROUP BY purpose
+  ORDER BY total_count DESC
+`);
+```
+
+### Using MySQL-Specific Features
+
+```typescript
+// JSON operations (MySQL 8+)
+await instance.database.update(
+  'consents',
+  { where: { id: 'some-uuid' } },
+  {
+    metadata: {
+      $raw: "JSON_SET(metadata, '$.preferences', ?)",
+      $params: [JSON.stringify({ email: true, sms: false })]
+    }
+  }
+);
+
+// Full-text search (requires FULLTEXT index)
+const searchResults = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: {
+    $raw: "MATCH(name, email) AGAINST(? IN BOOLEAN MODE)",
+    $params: ['john email']
+  }
+});
+```
+
+## Performance Optimization
+
+```typescript
+// Create optimized indexes
+await instance.database.raw(`
+  -- Standard index for lookups
+  CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
+  
+  -- Fulltext index for search
+  CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_users_fulltext ON users(name, email);
+`);
+
+// Set server variables
+await instance.database.raw(`
+  SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1073741824; -- 1GB
+  SET GLOBAL max_connections = 200;
+`);
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Use InnoDB tables** for transactions and foreign key support
+- **Set appropriate character sets** (utf8mb4 recommended for full Unicode support)
+- **Configure connection pooling** for efficient resource management
+- **Create proper indexes** on frequently queried columns
+- **Use prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection (handled automatically)
+- **Consider table partitioning** for very large tables
+- **Regularly optimize tables** for performance maintenance
+
+## Monitoring and Management
+
+```typescript
+// Check database health
+const health = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT 
+    DATABASE() AS database,
+    VERSION() AS version,
+    @@character_set_database AS charset,
+    @@collation_database AS collation
+`);
+
+// Monitoring query performance
+const slowQueries = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT query, count_star, sum_timer_wait
+  FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest
+  ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC
+  LIMIT 10
+`);
+```
+
+## Limitations
+
+- JSON support is less powerful than PostgreSQL (especially in MySQL 5.7)
+- Requires a running MySQL/MariaDB server
+- Default isolation level may differ from other databases
+- Some ALTER TABLE operations require table rebuilds

+title: PostgreSQL Adapter
+description: The PostgreSQL adapter provides integration with PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source relational database system known for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
+---
+## Installation
+
+Install the PostgreSQL adapter and its dependencies:
+
+```package-install
+@c15t/backend-postgres pg @types/pg
+```
+
+## Configuration
+
+Configure the PostgreSQL adapter with your connection details:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { postgresAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/postgres';
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: postgresAdapter({
+    // Connection string approach
+    connectionString: 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/c15t',
+    
+    // Or detailed configuration
+    connection: {
+      host: 'localhost',
+      port: 5432,
+      database: 'c15t',
+      user: 'postgres',
+      password: 'password',
+      ssl: false, // Set to true for SSL connections
+    },
+    
+    // Connection pool configuration
+    pool: {
+      min: 2,
+      max: 10,
+      idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
+    },
+    
+    // Query logging (for development)
+    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
+    
+    // Schema to use (default: public)
+    schema: 'public',
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Schema Management
+
+Initialize your database schema:
+
+```typescript
+const createSchema = async (db) => {
+  await db.raw(`
+    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
+      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
+      name TEXT NOT NULL,
+      email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
+      created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
+    );
+    
+    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consents (
+      id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
+      user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
+      purpose TEXT NOT NULL,
+      granted BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
+      timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
+      metadata JSONB
+    );
+    
+    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_consents_user_id ON consents(user_id);
+    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_consents_purpose ON consents(purpose);
+  `);
+};
+
+// Use in initialization
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: postgresAdapter({
+    connectionString: 'postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/c15t',
+    onInit: createSchema,
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('users', {
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+  // id and created_at will be auto-generated
+});
+
+// Find records with powerful filtering
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: { email: { $like: '%@example.com' } },
+  orderBy: { created_at: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10,
+  offset: 20
+});
+
+// Update a record
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete a record
+await instance.database.delete('users', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+### Transactions
+
+```typescript
+await instance.database.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  // All operations in this function use the same transaction
+  const user = await trx.create('users', {
+    name: 'Alice Johnson',
+    email: 'alice@example.com'
+  });
+  
+  await trx.create('consents', {
+    user_id: user.id,
+    purpose: 'marketing',
+    granted: true,
+    metadata: { source: 'website', campaign: 'summer2023' }
+  });
+  
+  // Transaction automatically commits unless an error is thrown
+});
+```
+
+### Advanced Queries
+
+```typescript
+// JSON filtering (PostgreSQL specific)
+const users = await instance.database.find('consents', {
+  where: {
+    'metadata->source': 'website',
+    'metadata->campaign': 'summer2023'
+  }
+});
+
+// Raw SQL for complex queries
+const stats = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT 
+    purpose, 
+    COUNT(*) as total_count,
+    SUM(CASE WHEN granted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as granted_count
+  FROM consents
+  GROUP BY purpose
+  ORDER BY total_count DESC
+`);
+```
+
+### Using PostgreSQL-Specific Features
+
+```typescript
+// JSONB operations
+await instance.database.update(
+  'consents',
+  { where: { id: 'some-uuid' } },
+  {
+    metadata: {
+      $query: 'jsonb_set(metadata, \'{preferences}\', $1)',
+      $params: ['{"email":true,"sms":false}']
+    }
+  }
+);
+
+// Full-text search
+const searchResults = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: {
+    $raw: 'to_tsvector(name || \' \' || email) @@ to_tsquery($1)',
+    $params: ['john & email']
+  }
+});
+```
+
+## Performance Optimization
+
+```typescript
+// Create optimized indexes
+await instance.database.raw(`
+  -- B-tree index for exact lookups
+  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_email ON users(email);
+  
+  -- GIN index for JSONB
+  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_consents_metadata ON consents USING GIN (metadata);
+  
+  -- Partial index for active users
+  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_active_users ON users(created_at) 
+  WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
+`);
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Use connection pooling** for efficient resource management
+- **Implement database indexes** for frequently queried columns
+- **Use transactions** for operations that must succeed or fail together
+- **Consider using prepared statements** for repetitive queries (handled automatically)
+- **Leverage PostgreSQL-specific features** like JSON/JSONB, array types, and full-text search
+- **Regularly VACUUM and ANALYZE** your database for performance maintenance
+- **Set appropriate statement timeouts** to prevent long-running queries
+
+## Monitoring and Management
+
+```typescript
+// Check database health
+const health = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT 
+    current_database() AS database,
+    current_setting('server_version') AS version,
+    pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database())) AS size
+`);
+
+// Monitoring query performance
+const slowQueries = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
+  FROM pg_stat_statements
+  ORDER BY total_time DESC
+  LIMIT 10
+`);
+```
+
+## Limitations
+
+- Requires a running PostgreSQL server
+- More complex setup compared to SQLite
+- Connection management adds complexity

+title: SQLite Adapter
+description: The SQLite adapter provides a lightweight, file-based database solution perfect for small to medium applications, local development, and embedded systems.
+---
+## Installation
+
+Install the SQLite adapter and its dependencies:
+
+```package-install
+@c15t/backend-sqlite better-sqlite3 @types/better-sqlite3
+```
+
+## Configuration
+
+Configure the SQLite adapter with your database file path:
+
+```typescript
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { sqliteAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/sqlite';
+
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: sqliteAdapter({
+    // File path for the SQLite database (use :memory: for in-memory database)
+    filename: './data/c15t.db',
+    
+    // Optional: Enable WAL mode for better concurrency (default: true)
+    useWAL: true,
+    
+    // Optional: Set journal mode (default: 'wal')
+    journalMode: 'wal', // 'delete', 'truncate', 'persist', 'memory', 'wal', 'off'
+    
+    // Optional: Enable foreign keys (default: true)
+    foreignKeys: true,
+    
+    // Optional: Set busy timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)
+    busyTimeout: 5000,
+    
+    // Optional: Initialize schema if not exists
+    initSchema: true,
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+### In-Memory Database
+
+For testing or development, you can use an in-memory database:
+
+```typescript
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: sqliteAdapter({
+    filename: ':memory:',
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Schema Management
+
+Initialize your database schema:
+
+```typescript
+const createSchema = async (db) => {
+  await db.exec(`
+    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
+      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
+      name TEXT NOT NULL,
+      email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
+      created_at INTEGER DEFAULT (unixepoch())
+    );
+    
+    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consents (
+      id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
+      user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
+      purpose TEXT NOT NULL,
+      granted BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
+      timestamp INTEGER DEFAULT (unixepoch()),
+      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
+    );
+    
+    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_consents_user_id ON consents(user_id);
+  `);
+};
+
+// Use in initialization
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  database: sqliteAdapter({
+    filename: './data/c15t.db',
+    onInit: createSchema,
+  }),
+});
+```
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+### Basic CRUD Operations
+
+```typescript
+// Create a new record
+const user = await instance.database.create('users', {
+  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
+  name: 'John Doe',
+  email: 'john@example.com'
+});
+
+// Find records
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: { email: 'john@example.com' },
+  orderBy: { created_at: 'desc' },
+  limit: 10
+});
+
+// Update a record
+const updatedUser = await instance.database.update(
+  'users',
+  { where: { id: user.id } },
+  { name: 'John Smith' }
+);
+
+// Delete a record
+await instance.database.delete('users', { where: { id: user.id } });
+```
+
+### Transactions
+
+```typescript
+await instance.database.transaction(async (trx) => {
+  // All operations inside use the same transaction
+  const user = await trx.create('users', {
+    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
+    name: 'Alice Johnson',
+    email: 'alice@example.com'
+  });
+  
+  await trx.create('consents', {
+    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
+    user_id: user.id,
+    purpose: 'marketing',
+    granted: true
+  });
+  
+  // Transaction automatically commits unless an error is thrown
+});
+```
+
+### Advanced Queries
+
+```typescript
+// Complex where conditions
+const users = await instance.database.find('users', {
+  where: {
+    $or: [
+      { name: { $like: '%John%' } },
+      { email: { $like: '%@example.com' } }
+    ],
+    created_at: { $gt: Date.now() - 86400000 } // Last 24 hours
+  }
+});
+
+// Raw queries for specific needs
+const stats = await instance.database.raw(`
+  SELECT purpose, COUNT(*) as count
+  FROM consents
+  WHERE granted = true
+  GROUP BY purpose
+  ORDER BY count DESC
+`);
+```
+
+## Performance Optimization
+
+```typescript
+// Enable pragmas for better performance
+await instance.database.raw(`
+  PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
+  PRAGMA cache_size = -64000; -- 64MB
+  PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;
+  PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456; -- 256MB
+`);
+```
+
+## Backup and Maintenance
+
+```typescript
+// Backup database
+await instance.database.raw(`
+  VACUUM INTO '/backup/c15t-backup.db';
+`);
+
+// Optimize database
+await instance.database.raw(`
+  PRAGMA optimize;
+  VACUUM;
+`);
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+- **Use WAL mode** for better concurrency and performance
+- **Create proper indexes** on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses
+- **Use transactions** for operations that must be atomic
+- **Implement regular backups** using VACUUM INTO
+- **Set busy timeout** to handle concurrent access conflicts
+- **Use prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection (handled automatically by the adapter)
+
+## Limitations
+
+- Limited concurrency compared to client-server databases
+- No built-in user management or access control
+- Maximum database size limited to 281 TB (though practical limits are much lower)
+- Limited support for ALTER TABLE operations

+title: Plugin System
+description: Complete guide to the plugin system in c15t Backend, including plugin types, lifecycle hooks, context extensions, and best practices.
+---
+
+The c15t Backend plugin system provides a powerful way to extend and customize the functionality of your consent management system. This guide covers everything you need to know about plugins, from basic usage to advanced features.
+
+## Overview
+
+Plugins are modular components that can:
+- Extend the context with additional data
+- Modify requests and responses
+- Add new routes and endpoints
+- Provide custom middleware
+- Hook into the request lifecycle
+
+## Plugin Types
+
+### Core Plugins
+Core plugins are essential system components that provide fundamental functionality:
+
+```typescript
+const corePlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'core-plugin',
+  name: 'Core Plugin',
+  type: 'core',
+  init: () => ({
+    context: {
+      systemInfo: {
+        version: '1.0.0',
+        environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
+      },
+    },
+  }),
+};
+```
+
+### Feature Plugins
+Feature plugins add specific functionality to your system:
+
+```typescript
+const featurePlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'feature-plugin',
+  name: 'Feature Plugin',
+  type: 'feature',
+  init: () => ({
+    routes: [
+      {
+        path: '/api/custom',
+        method: 'GET',
+        handler: async (request, ctx) => {
+          return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Custom endpoint' }));
+        },
+      },
+    ],
+  }),
+};
+```
+
+### Middleware Plugins
+Middleware plugins process requests and responses:
+
+```typescript
+const middlewarePlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'middleware-plugin',
+  name: 'Middleware Plugin',
+  type: 'middleware',
+  onRequest: async (request, ctx) => {
+    // Add request processing
+    return { request };
+  },
+  onResponse: async (response, ctx) => {
+    // Add response processing
+    return { response };
+  },
+};
+```
+
+## Plugin Lifecycle
+
+### Initialization
+Plugins are initialized when the c15t instance is created:
+
+```typescript
+const instance = c15tInstance({
+  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+  database: memoryAdapter({}),
+  plugins: [
+    corePlugin,
+    featurePlugin,
+    middlewarePlugin,
+  ],
+});
+```
+
+### Request Lifecycle
+Plugins can hook into various stages of request processing:
+
+```typescript
+const lifecyclePlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'lifecycle-plugin',
+  name: 'Lifecycle Plugin',
+  type: 'middleware',
+  onRequest: async (request, ctx) => {
+    console.log('Request received');
+    return { request };
+  },
+  onBeforeHandler: async (request, ctx) => {
+    console.log('Before handler');
+    return { request };
+  },
+  onAfterHandler: async (response, ctx) => {
+    console.log('After handler');
+    return { response };
+  },
+  onResponse: async (response, ctx) => {
+    console.log('Response sent');
+    return { response };
+  },
+};
+```
+
+## Context Extensions
+
+Plugins can extend the context with additional data:
+
+```typescript
+const contextPlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'context-plugin',
+  name: 'Context Plugin',
+  type: 'core',
+  init: () => ({
+    context: {
+      customData: {
+        timestamp: Date.now(),
+        requestId: generateId(),
+      },
+    },
+  }),
+};
+```
+
+## Custom Routes
+
+Plugins can add custom routes to your API:
+
+```typescript
+const routePlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'route-plugin',
+  name: 'Route Plugin',
+  type: 'feature',
+  init: () => ({
+    routes: [
+      {
+        path: '/api/custom',
+        method: 'GET',
+        handler: async (request, ctx) => {
+          const data = await ctx.database.find('custom', {});
+          return new Response(JSON.stringify(data));
+        },
+      },
+      {
+        path: '/api/custom',
+        method: 'POST',
+        handler: async (request, ctx) => {
+          const data = await request.json();
+          const result = await ctx.database.create('custom', data);
+          return new Response(JSON.stringify(result));
+        },
+      },
+    ],
+  }),
+};
+```
+
+## Error Handling
+
+Plugins can handle errors at different levels:
+
+```typescript
+const errorPlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'error-plugin',
+  name: 'Error Plugin',
+  type: 'middleware',
+  onError: async (error, ctx) => {
+    console.error('Plugin error:', error);
+    return {
+      response: new Response(
+        JSON.stringify({ error: 'Internal server error' }),
+        { status: 500 }
+      ),
+    };
+  },
+};
+```
+
+## Plugin Dependencies
+
+Plugins can declare dependencies on other plugins:
+
+```typescript
+const dependentPlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+  id: 'dependent-plugin',
+  name: 'Dependent Plugin',
+  type: 'feature',
+  dependencies: ['core-plugin', 'auth-plugin'],
+  init: (ctx) => {
+    // Access dependent plugin data
+    const coreData = ctx.plugins['core-plugin'].data;
+    const authData = ctx.plugins['auth-plugin'].data;
+    
+    return {
+      context: {
+        combinedData: {
+          ...coreData,
+          ...authData,
+        },
+      },
+    };
+  },
+};
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+1. **Plugin Organization**
+   ```typescript
+   // plugins/index.ts
+   export const plugins: C15TPlugin[] = [
+     corePlugin,
+     authPlugin,
+     loggingPlugin,
+     customPlugin,
+   ];
+   ```
+
+2. **Error Handling**
+   ```typescript
+   const safePlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+     id: 'safe-plugin',
+     name: 'Safe Plugin',
+     type: 'middleware',
+     onRequest: async (request, ctx) => {
+       try {
+         // Plugin logic
+         return { request };
+       } catch (error) {
+         console.error('Plugin error:', error);
+         return { error };
+       }
+     },
+   };
+   ```
+
+3. **Performance Optimization**
+   ```typescript
+   const optimizedPlugin: C15TPlugin = {
+     id: 'optimized-plugin',
+     name: 'Optimized Plugin',
+     type: 'middleware',
+     onRequest: async (request, ctx) => {
+       // Cache expensive operations
+       const cacheKey = request.url;
+       const cached = await ctx.cache.get(cacheKey);
+       if (cached) {
+         return { request, cached };
+       }
+       
+       // Perform operation
+       const result = await expensiveOperation();
+       await ctx.cache.set(cacheKey, result);
+       
+       return { request, result };
+     },
+   };
+   ```
+
+## Testing Plugins
+
+### Unit Testing
+```typescript
+describe('Custom Plugin', () => {
+  it('should extend context', async () => {
+    const plugin = customPlugin;
+    const ctx = { context: {} };
+    
+    const result = await plugin.init(ctx);
+    expect(result.context).toHaveProperty('customData');
+  });
+  
+  it('should handle requests', async () => {
+    const plugin = customPlugin;
+    const request = new Request('http://localhost:3000');
+    const ctx = { context: {} };
+    
+    const result = await plugin.onRequest(request, ctx);
+    expect(result.request).toBeDefined();
+  });
+});
+```
+
+### Integration Testing
+```typescript
+describe('Plugin Integration', () => {
+  it('should work with other plugins', async () => {
+    const instance = c15tInstance({
+      baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
+      database: memoryAdapter({}),
+      plugins: [plugin1, plugin2],
+    });
+    
+    const request = new Request('http://localhost:3000/api/test');
+    const response = await instance.handler(request);
+    
+    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
+  });
+});
+```
+
+## Common Issues
+
+1. **Plugin Order**
+   - Plugins are executed in the order they are provided
+   - Dependencies should be listed first
+   - Core plugins should be initialized before feature plugins
+
+2. **Context Access**
+   - Always check for context existence
+   - Use optional chaining for nested properties
+   - Provide default values when needed
+
+3. **Error Propagation**
+   - Handle errors at the appropriate level
+   - Log errors for debugging
+   - Return appropriate error responses

+title: "Callbacks"
+description: "Learn how to use callbacks to respond to consent management events in both JavaScript and React applications."
+---
+
+## Overview
+
+Callbacks allow you to execute custom code in response to various consent management events. They provide a way to integrate consent management with your application's logic, analytics, and other features.
+
+## Available Callbacks
+
+The following callbacks are available your the c15t config.
+
+### Callback Reference
+
+- `onError`: Called when an API request fails.
+- `onConsentBannerFetched`: Called after successfully fetching the consent banner information.
+- `onConsentSet`: Called after successfully setting consent preferences.
+- `onConsentVerified`: Called after successfully verifying consent.
+
+### Offline Mode Callbacks
+
+Some callbacks require a call to an endpoint meaning they will not work fully in offline mode.
+
+- `onConsentBannerFetched`: Will always return a simulated response of true, unless consent is in local storage.
+- `onConsentSet`: Stores consent in local storage.
+- `onConsentVerified`: Will always return a simulated response of true, unless consent is in local storage.
+
+
+
+## Usage Examples
+
+```typescript
+import { configureConsentManager, type ConsentManagerOptions } from 'c15t';
+
+const c15tConfig: ConsentManagerOptions = {
+  // ...
+  callbacks: {
+    onConsentSet: ({ data }) => {
+      if (data.preferences.measurement) {
+        // Add your scripts here to enable analytics
+      }
+    }
+  }
+};
+```
+
+## Callback Response Types
+
+Callback responses are always of type `ResponseContext<T>`. 
+
+<auto-type-table path="../node_modules/c15t/src/client/types.ts" name="ResponseContext" />
+
+### onConsentSet Data
+
+The `onConsentSet` callback receives consent preference details:
+
+<auto-type-table path="../node_modules/c15t/src/client/client-interface.ts" name="ConsentSetCallbackPayload" />
+
+### onConsentVerified Data
+
+The `onConsentVerified` callback receives verification results:
+
+<auto-type-table path="../node_modules/c15t/src/client/client-interface.ts" name="ConsentVerifiedCallbackPayload" />
+
+### onConsentBannerFetched Data
+
+The `onConsentBannerFetched` callback receives banner information:
+
+<auto-type-table path="../node_modules/c15t/src/client/client-interface.ts" name="ConsentBannerFetchedCallbackPayload" />

+title: Consent Manager Dialog
+description: An accessible, animated modal interface that wraps the Consent Manager Widget for a focused privacy customization experience.
+---
+import { LayersIcon, CookieIcon, ToggleRightIcon } from 'lucide-react';
+import DialogExample from '~/examples/react/dialog';
+
+The Consent Manager Dialog provides a clean, focused way for users to customize their privacy preferences. Think of it as a spotlight that dims the rest of your application while users make important privacy decisions. When users click "Customize" on your cookie banner, this dialog smoothly appears with detailed privacy controls.
+
+<DialogExample  />
+
+## How It Works
+
+The dialog acts as a wrapper around the Consent Manager Widget, adding several key features:
+1. A smooth fade-in animation that draws attention to privacy settings
+2. An overlay that dims the rest of the application
+3. Proper focus management for accessibility
+4. Automatic portal rendering to avoid layout issues
+5. Smart handling of mounting and unmounting
+
+Let's explore how to implement this in your application.
+
+## Quick Start
+
+First, install the package if you haven't already:
+
+{/* ```package-install
+@c15t/react
+``` */}
+
+Then add the dialog to your application:
+
+```tsx
+import {
+	ConsentManagerDialog,
+	ConsentManagerProvider,
+} from "@c15t/react";
+
+function App() {
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider>
+      <YourApp />
+      <ConsentManagerDialog />
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  )
+}
+```
+
+The dialog will automatically:
+- Mount itself correctly in the DOM
+- Handle animations smoothly
+- Manage focus when opened
+- Maintain accessibility standards
+
+## Understanding Animations
+
+The dialog uses thoughtful animations to create a polished user experience. When opened, it:
+1. Fades in an overlay to dim the background
+2. Scales and fades in the dialog content
+3. Smoothly reverses these animations when closing
+
+You can control this behavior with the `disableAnimation` prop:
+
+```tsx
+// Disable animations if needed
+<ConsentManagerDialog disableAnimation />
+```
+
+## Customizing Appearance
+
+The dialog supports two main approaches to styling:
+
+### Using Themes
+
+Apply custom styles through the theme prop:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerDialog
+  theme={{
+    "widget.root": "",
+	  "widget.branding": "",
+	  "widget.footer": "",
+	  "widget.footer.sub-group": "",
+		"widget.footer.reject-button": "",
+		"widget.footer.accept-button": "",
+		"widget.footer.customize-button": "",
+		"widget.footer.save-button": "",
+		"widget.accordion": "",
+		"widget.accordion.trigger": "",
+		"widget.accordion.trigger-inner": "",
+		"widget.accordion.item": "",
+		"widget.accordion.icon": "",
+		"widget.accordion.arrow.open": "",
+		"widget.accordion.arrow.close": "",
+		"widget.accordion.content": "",
+		"widget.accordion.content-inner": "",
+		"widget.switch": "",
+		"widget.switch.track": "",
+		"widget.switch.thumb": "",
+		"widget.dialog": "",
+		"widget.dialog.root": "",
+		"widget.dialog.header": "",
+		"widget.dialog.title": "",
+		"widget.dialog.description": "",
+		"widget.dialog.content": "",
+		"widget.dialog.footer": "",
+		"widget.overlay": "",
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+### Removing Default Styles
+
+For complete styling control, disable the default styles:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerDialog noStyle />
+```
+
+This gives you a blank canvas to build upon while maintaining the dialog's functionality.
+
+## Integration Examples
+
+### With Custom Trigger Button
+
+```tsx
+function PrivacyCenter() {
+  const consentManager = useConsentManager()
+  
+  return (
+    <button
+      onClick={() => consentManager.setIsPrivacyDialogOpen(true)}
+      className="privacy-button"
+    >
+      Privacy Settings
+    </button>
+  )
+}
+```
+
+## Accessibility Features
+
+The dialog implements several accessibility best practices:
+
+### Focus Management
+When the dialog opens, it:
+1. Traps focus within the dialog
+2. Sets initial focus on the first interactive element
+3. Remembers and restores the previous focus position when closed
+
+### Focus Trapping
+
+The dialog implements focus trapping to ensure keyboard navigation remains within the dialog while it's open. This is crucial for:
+
+- **Keyboard users**: Prevents users from accidentally interacting with content hidden behind the modal
+- **Screen reader users**: Maintains proper context and prevents confusion
+- **WCAG compliance**: Supports 2.4.3 Focus Order and provides proper modal functionality
+
+#### How Focus Trapping Works
+
+The `ConsentManagerDialog` uses the `useFocusTrap` hook internally to:
+
+1. Capture the element that had focus before the dialog opened
+2. Set initial focus to the first interactive element inside the dialog
+3. Keep focus cycling within the dialog when users press Tab or Shift+Tab
+4. Restore focus to the original element when the dialog closes
+
+You can control focus trapping with the `trapFocus` prop:
+
+```tsx
+// Default behavior (recommended for accessibility)
+<ConsentManagerDialog trapFocus={true} />
+
+// Disable focus trapping (not recommended)
+<ConsentManagerDialog trapFocus={false} />
+```
+
+<Callout type="info">
+  Focus trapping is enabled by default and is recommended for WCAG compliance. Only disable it if you have a specific reason and are implementing alternative accessibility measures.
+</Callout>
+
+### Keyboard Navigation
+Users can:
+- Close the dialog with the Escape key
+- Navigate controls with Tab
+- Interact with all elements using only the keyboard
+
+### Screen Readers
+The dialog announces itself appropriately with:
+- Proper ARIA roles and attributes
+- Clear labeling of controls
+- Status updates when opened/closed
+
+## Technical Details
+
+### Portal Rendering
+
+The dialog uses React's createPortal to render outside your main application hierarchy. This ensures:
+- No CSS specificity conflicts
+- Proper stacking context
+- Clean DOM structure
+
+### Client-side Only
+
+To prevent hydration issues, the dialog only renders on the client side. This is handled automatically through the `isMounted` state.
+
+## API Reference
+
+### Props
+
+| Prop | Type | Description | Default |
+|------|------|-------------|---------|
+| theme | ConsentManagerWidgetTheme | Theme configuration | {} |
+| disableAnimation | boolean | Turns off animations | false |
+| noStyle | boolean | Removes default styles | false |
+
+### Theme Properties
+
+| Property | Purpose | Example Value |
+|----------|---------|---------------|
+| dialog | Main dialog container | "fixed inset-0" |
+| overlay | Background overlay | "bg-black/50" |
+| content | Dialog content wrapper | "bg-white p-4" |
+
+## Best Practices
+
+1. **Performance**
+   - Only import the dialog where needed
+   - Consider lazy loading if not immediately required
+   - Use the disableAnimation prop on lower-end devices
+
+2. **User Experience**
+   - Keep the dialog focused on privacy settings
+   - Provide clear save/cancel actions
+   - Maintain consistent styling with your application
+
+3. **Accessibility**
+   - Test with keyboard navigation
+   - Verify screen reader announcements
+   - Ensure sufficient color contrast

+title: Consent Manager Widget
+description: A flexible, composable widget for building custom privacy consent interfaces. The widget provides granular control over privacy preferences while handling all the compliance requirements for you.
+---
+import { LayersIcon, CookieIcon } from 'lucide-react';
+import WidgetExample from '~/examples/react/widget';
+
+The Consent Manager Widget serves as the core interface for detailed privacy consent management in your application. While the Cookie Banner handles initial consent, this widget enables users to fine-tune their privacy preferences through an intuitive accordion interface.
+
+<WidgetExample />
+
+## Understanding the Widget
+
+Think of the Consent Manager Widget as a highly customizable form that gives users control over their privacy choices. It organizes different types of data collection and processing into collapsible sections, making it easy for users to understand and manage their consent preferences.
+
+For example, a typical widget might include sections for:
+- Essential cookies that keep your site running
+- Analytics that help improve user experience
+- Marketing features that enable personalized content
+- Third-party integrations that enhance functionality
+
+The widget automatically handles the complex task of tracking and storing these preferences while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.
+
+## Quick Start
+
+First, install the package:
+
+{/* ```package-install
+@c15t/react
+``` */}
+
+Then add the widget to your application:
+
+```tsx
+import * as ConsentManagerWidget from '@c15t/react/consent-manager-widget'
+
+function PrivacyPreferences() {
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerWidget>
+      <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionItems />
+      <ConsentManagerWidget.Footer>
+        <ConsentManagerWidget.RejectButton>
+          Reject All
+        </ConsentManagerWidget.RejectButton>
+        <ConsentManagerWidget.AcceptAllButton>
+          Accept All
+        </ConsentManagerWidget.AcceptAllButton>
+      </ConsentManagerWidget.Footer>
+    </ConsentManagerWidget>
+  )
+}
+```
+
+## Component Architecture
+
+The Consent Manager Widget uses a compound component pattern, which means it's built from smaller, specialized components that work together. This approach gives you complete control over the widget's structure and appearance.
+
+Let's break down the main building blocks:
+
+### Root Component
+The `ConsentManagerWidget` serves as the container and context provider for all other components:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerWidget theme={yourTheme}>
+  {/* Child components go here */}
+</ConsentManagerWidget>
+```
+
+### Accordion Interface
+The accordion interface organizes privacy preferences into expandable sections:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerWidget>
+  <ConsentManagerWidget.Accordion>
+    <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionItems />
+  </ConsentManagerWidget.Accordion>
+</ConsentManagerWidget>
+```
+
+### Custom Accordion Items
+You can create custom sections for specific types of consent:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerWidget.Accordion>
+  <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionItem value="analytics">
+    <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionTrigger>
+      Analytics Cookies
+      <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionArrow />
+    </ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionTrigger>
+    <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionContent>
+      <ConsentManagerWidget.Switch name="analytics" />
+      We use analytics cookies to understand how you use our website.
+    </ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionContent>
+  </ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionItem>
+</ConsentManagerWidget.Accordion>
+```
+
+### Action Buttons
+The widget includes several pre-built buttons for common actions:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerWidget.Footer>
+  <ConsentManagerWidget.FooterSubGroup>
+    <ConsentManagerWidget.RejectButton>
+      Reject All
+    </ConsentManagerWidget.RejectButton>
+    <ConsentManagerWidget.AcceptAllButton>
+      Accept All
+    </ConsentManagerWidget.AcceptAllButton>
+  </ConsentManagerWidget.FooterSubGroup>
+  <ConsentManagerWidget.SaveButton>
+    Save Preferences
+  </ConsentManagerWidget.SaveButton>
+</ConsentManagerWidget.Footer>
+```
+
+## Customization
+
+The widget supports several ways to customize its appearance and behavior:
+
+### Theme Customization

+		"widget.accordion.content-inner": "",
+		"widget.switch": "",
+		"widget.switch.track": "",
+		"widget.switch.thumb": "",
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+### Custom Layouts
+Create completely custom layouts while maintaining functionality:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerWidget>
+  <YourCustomHeader />
+  <ConsentManagerWidget.AccordionItems />
+  <YourCustomFooter>
+    <ConsentManagerWidget.SaveButton asChild>
+      <YourButton variant="primary" />
+    </ConsentManagerWidget.SaveButton>
+  </YourCustomFooter>
+</ConsentManagerWidget>
+```
+
+### Branding
+Control the visibility of c15t.com branding:
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerWidget hideBranding={true} />
+```
+

+Before diving into implementation, let's understand what makes a cookie banner effective. A good cookie banner needs to:
+
+- Inform users about data collection clearly and concisely
+- Obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies
+- Provide easy ways to accept, reject, or customize preferences
+- Remember user choices across sessions
+- Meet legal requirements across different jurisdictions
+
+Our Cookie Banner component handles all of these requirements automatically, while remaining fully customizable to match your application's design.
+
+## Quick Start
+
+Let's add a basic cookie banner to your application. First, install the package: 
+```package-install
+@c15t/react
+```
+
+Then add the banner to your root component:
+
+```tsx
+import {
+	ConsentManagerProvider,
+	CookieBanner,
+} from "@c15t/react";
+
+function App() {
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider>
+      <YourApp />
+      <CookieBanner />
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+```
+
+That's it! The banner will automatically:
+
+- Appear on first visit
+- Remember user choices
+- Handle consent management
+- Stay compliant with privacy laws
+
+## Component Architecture
+
+The Cookie Banner uses a compound component pattern, giving you complete control over its structure when needed. Think of it like building blocks – you can use the pre-assembled version, or arrange the pieces yourself for custom layouts.
+
+<Tabs groupId="Version" items={["Recommended", "Expanded"]}>
+  <Tab value="Recommended">
+  ```tsx 
+import { CookieBanner } from "@c15t/react";
+
+const Banner = () => {
+	return (
+		<CookieBanner
+			title="We value your privacy"
+			description="We use cookies to enhance your experience"
+		/>
+	);
+};
+
+````
+</Tab>
+<Tab value="expanded">
+```tsx
+import * as CookieBanner from "@c15t/react/cookie-banner";
+
+const Banner = () => {
+	return (
+		<CookieBanner.Root>
+			<CookieBanner.Card>
+				<CookieBanner.Header>
+					<CookieBanner.Title>Custom Title</CookieBanner.Title>
+					<CookieBanner.Description>Your detailed description here</CookieBanner.Description>
+				</CookieBanner.Header>
+				<CookieBanner.Footer>
+					<CookieBanner.FooterSubGroup>
+						<CookieBanner.RejectButton>Decline All</CookieBanner.RejectButton>
+						<CookieBanner.CustomizeButton>Preferences</CookieBanner.CustomizeButton>
+					</CookieBanner.FooterSubGroup>
+					<CookieBanner.AcceptButton>Accept All</CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
+				</CookieBanner.Footer>
+			</CookieBanner.Card>
+		</CookieBanner.Root>
+	);
+};
+````
+
+  </Tab>
+</Tabs>
+
+## Customization
+
+The Cookie Banner is designed to adapt to your application's visual style. Here are the main ways to customize its appearance:
+
+### Using Themes
+
+Here are the available theme variables:
+
+<auto-type-table path="../../../node_modules/@c15t/react/src/components/cookie-banner/theme.ts" name="CookieBannerTheme" />
+
+The theme prop provides a straightforward way to customize the banner's appearance:
+
+```tsx
+import { CookieBanner } from "@c15t/react";
+
+const CustomCookieBanner = () => {
+  return (
+    <CookieBanner
+      theme={{
+        "banner.root": "",
+        "banner.title": "",
+        "banner.description": "",
+        "banner.footer": "",
+        "banner.root": "",
+        "banner.card": "",
+        "banner.header.root": "",
+        "banner.header.title": "",
+        "banner.header.description": "",
+        "banner.footer": "",
+        "banner.footer.sub-group": "",
+        "banner.overlay": "",
+        "banner.footer.reject-button": "",
+        "banner.footer.customize-button": "",
+        "banner.footer.accept-button": "",
+      }}
+    />
+  );
+};
+```
+
+### Using CSS Modules
+
+For more traditional styling approaches, you can use CSS modules:
+
+```tsx
+import { CookieBanner } from "@c15t/react";
+import styles from "./cookie-banner.module.css";
+
+const CSSModuleCookieBanner = () => {
+  return (
+    <CookieBanner
+      theme={{
+        "banner.root": styles.banner,
+        "banner.title": styles.title,
+        "banner.description": styles.description,
+      }}
+    />
+  );
+};
+```
+
+### Using Existing Components
+
+You can integrate your own component library using the `asChild` prop:
+
+```tsx
+import * as CookieBanner from "@c15t/react/cookie-banner";
+import { Button } from "./your-components";
+
+const CustomAcceptButton = () => {
+  return (
+    <CookieBanner.AcceptButton asChild>
+      <Button variant="primary">Accept All Cookies</Button>
+    </CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
+  );
+};
+```
+
+## Scroll Locking
+
+The Cookie Banner supports scroll locking, a technique that prevents users from interacting with your website until they've made a cookie consent choice.
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  lockScroll={true}
+/>
+```
+
+When enabled, scroll locking:
+- Prevents page scrolling and interaction
+- Displays a background overlay
+- Ensures users must make a privacy choice before accessing content
+
+For best results, use scroll locking together with [focus trapping](#focus-trapping) to ensure complete keyboard accessibility.
+
+<Callout>
+  For detailed implementation guides, best practices, and compliance considerations, see our [Scroll Locking Guide](/docs/framework/react/guides/scroll-locking).
+</Callout>
+
+## Accessibility
+
+The Cookie Banner is built with accessibility in mind:
+
+- Proper ARIA roles and labels (role="dialog", aria-modal="true")
+- Keyboard navigation and interaction support
+- Focus management and trapping
+- Screen reader announcements
+- Semantic HTML structure
+
+These features work automatically, ensuring all users can interact with your privacy controls effectively.
+
+### Focus Trapping
+
+The Cookie Banner implements focus trapping when it's displayed, which is an essential accessibility feature that prevents keyboard focus from moving outside the banner. This behavior:
+
+- **Ensures users complete the consent flow** before interacting with other page elements
+- **Prevents accidental interaction** with content that shouldn't be accessible yet
+- **Helps compliance** with accessibility guidelines like WCAG 2.4.3 (Focus Order)
+
+#### Implementation Details
+
+Focus trapping in the Cookie Banner works through the `CookieBannerCard` component, which:
+
+1. Uses the [`useFocusTrap`](/docs/framework/react/hooks/use-focus-trap) hook internally
+2. Automatically sets `tabIndex={0}` on the container
+3. Applies proper ARIA attributes (`role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`)
+4. Remembers the previously focused element and restores it when closed
+5. Cycles focus between interactive elements when Tab is pressed
+
+You can control focus trapping with the `trapFocus` prop:
+
+```tsx
+// Default behavior (recommended)
+<CookieBanner trapFocus={true} />
+
+// Disable focus trapping (use with caution)
+<CookieBanner trapFocus={false} />
+```
+
+<Callout>
+  Focus trapping is enabled by default and recommended for accessibility compliance. For more details on implementation and best practices, see our [useFocusTrap hook documentation](/docs/hooks/use-focus-trap).
+</Callout>
+
+## Best Practices
+
+Follow these guidelines for optimal implementation:
+
+1. Place the banner at the root level of your application
+2. Keep the title and description clear and concise
+3. Use the pre-assembled version unless you need custom layouts
+4. Test the banner across different screen sizes
+5. Ensure your theme maintains sufficient contrast ratios
+6. Consider [scroll locking](#scroll-locking) for strict compliance scenarios
+7. Test with keyboard navigation to ensure accessibility
+
+## Common Pitfalls

+title: Dev Tool
+description: Monitor and debug your privacy consent management with our development tools, designed to help you build with confidence.
+---
+
+Development tools provide real-time insight into how users interact with your privacy consent management system. With live state monitoring, intuitive debugging features, and customizable visualization options, you can ensure your privacy implementation works exactly as intended.
+
+## Understanding Dev Tools
+
+When building privacy-compliant applications, you need visibility into how consent is being managed. Our dev tools let you:
+
+- Watch consent changes in real-time as users interact with your privacy controls
+- Inspect the complete consent state at any point in time
+- Debug issues by tracking consent management flow
+- Validate that your privacy implementation works correctly
+
+Think of it like having a privacy-focused browser dev tools panel - but specifically designed for consent management.
+
+## Adding Dev Tools to Your Project
+
+First, install the development tools package:
+
+{/* ```package-install
+@c15t/dev-tools
+``` */}
+
+
+Then add the development tools to your application:
+
+```tsx
+import { C15TDevTools } from '@c15t/dev-tools';
+
+function App() {
+  return (
+    <>
+      <YourApp />
+      {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <C15TDevTools />}
+    </>
+  )
+}
+```
+
+The dev tools will automatically appear in your application during development. They're designed to be unobtrusive while still providing quick access to important information.
+
+
+## API Reference
+
+### PrivacyDevTools
+
+The main development tools component accepts these props:
+
+<auto-type-table path="../../../node_modules/@c15t/dev-tools/src/dev-tool.tsx" name="ConsentManagerProviderProps" />
+
+
+## Development Best Practices
+
+To get the most out of the development tools:
+
+1. Keep dev tools enabled during development and testing
+   - They help catch issues early
+   - Make debugging more efficient
+   - Provide insights into user behavior
+
+2. Use the inspection APIs to validate consent handling
+   - Verify consents are saved correctly
+   - Check that preferences persist properly
+   - Ensure privacy choices are respected
+
+3. Monitor consent flow during testing
+   - Track the user journey through consent management
+   - Identify potential UX improvements
+   - Validate compliance requirements
+
+4. Remove dev tools in production
+   ```tsx
+   // Automatically removed in production builds
+   {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && <C15TDevTools />}
+   ```
+
+## Security Considerations
+
+When using the development tools, keep in mind:
+
+- Dev tools may expose sensitive user preferences
+- Always remove dev tools before deploying to production
+- Be cautious when logging consent state
+- Consider privacy implications when sharing debug information
+
+
+## Troubleshooting Common Issues
+
+If you encounter problems:
+
+1. Verify the dev tools are only running in development
+2. Check that your privacy components are properly initialized
+3. Ensure the consent state namespace matches your configuration
+4. Look for error messages in the browser console
+
+Remember, the development tools are here to help you build better privacy experiences. Use them to understand, debug, and improve your consent management implementation.

+title: useFocusTrap
+description: The useFocusTrap hook provides accessibility-focused keyboard navigation management, keeping focus trapped within modal components for better user experience.
+---
+import UseFocusTrapExample from '~/examples/react/use-focus-trap';
+
+The `useFocusTrap` hook creates an accessible experience by preventing keyboard focus from leaving a specific container element (like a dialog or modal) until it's dismissed. This is essential for users navigating with keyboards or screen readers.
+
+## Usage
+
+This example shows how to implement focus trapping in a simple modal component:
+
+<UseFocusTrapExample/>
+
+## Parameters
+
+The hook accepts two parameters:
+
+| Parameter | Type | Description |
+|-----------|------|-------------|
+| shouldTrap | boolean | Controls whether focus should be trapped within the container |
+| containerRef | RefObject\<HTMLElement\> \| null | Reference to the DOM element that should contain the focus |
+
+## Returns
+
+This hook doesn't return any values. It works by managing the focus behavior of the DOM through side effects.
+
+## How It Works
+
+When activated, the `useFocusTrap` hook:
+
+1. Stores the element that was focused before trapping began
+2. Finds all focusable elements within the container
+3. Sets initial focus to the first focusable element (or the container itself)
+4. Captures Tab and Shift+Tab keystrokes to cycle focus within the container
+5. Restores focus to the original element when the component unmounts or `shouldTrap` becomes false
+
+## Notes
+
+- Hook must be called with a valid element reference that contains focusable elements
+- Adding `tabIndex={0}` to the container ensures it can receive focus if no focusable children exist
+- Always include proper ARIA attributes (`role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`) for screen reader accessibility
+- The hook automatically restores focus to the previously focused element when the component unmounts
+- Set `shouldTrap` to false when you want to disable focus trapping temporarily
+
+## Accessibility Compliance
+
+Using this hook helps your application comply with these WCAG 2.1 requirements:
+
+- [2.1.2: No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html) - While this criterion warns against trapping keyboard focus, modal dialogs are an exception when implemented properly
+- [2.4.3: Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html) - Ensures focus moves in a meaningful sequence
+
+## Usage with c15t Components
+
+Many c15t components like `CookieBannerCard` and `ConsentManagerDialog` use this hook internally, so you don't need to implement it yourself when using these components. The `trapFocus` prop can be used to control this behavior:
+
+```tsx
+// The dialog will automatically trap focus when open
+<ConsentManagerDialog trapFocus={true} />
+
+// Focus trapping can be disabled if needed
+<CookieBannerCard trapFocus={false}>
+  {/* Content */}
+</CookieBannerCard>
+```
+
+## Implementation Example
+
+Here's how focus trapping is implemented in the `CookieBannerCard` component:
+
+```tsx
+const CookieBannerCard = forwardRef(({ children, ...props }, ref) => {
+  const { trapFocus } = useTheme();
+  const localRef = useRef(null);
+  const cardRef = (ref || localRef);
+  
+  // Convert to boolean and enable focus trapping
+  const shouldTrapFocus = Boolean(trapFocus);
+  useFocusTrap(shouldTrapFocus, cardRef);
+  
+  return (
+    <Box
+      ref={ref}
+      tabIndex={0}
+      aria-modal={shouldTrapFocus ? 'true' : undefined}
+      role={shouldTrapFocus ? 'dialog' : undefined}
+      {...props}
+    >
+      {children}
+    </Box>
+  );
+});
+```

+title: Introduction to Consent Management (c15t)
+description: Transform privacy consent from a compliance checkbox into a fully observable system. Built for modern development teams, c15t unifies analytics, consent tracking, and privacy controls into a single performant solution - no more slow cookie banners or blind spots in user privacy choices.
+---
+
+## What is Consent Management?
+
+Consent Management (c15t) is an open-source platform that transforms privacy consent from a compliance checkbox into a fully observable system. Built for modern development teams, it provides a unified solution for:
+
+- Analytics integration
+- Consent management
+- Privacy controls
+- Complete consent state visibility
+
+Gone are the days of:
+- Cookie banners slowing down your site
+- Blind spots in consent tracking
+- Complex multi-vendor implementations 
+- Uncertainty about privacy policy changes
+- Poor visibility into consent states
+
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### 1. Open Source First
+Building in public isn't just about transparency - it's about creating better tools through community collaboration. Our open-source foundation means you can:
+
+- Inspect and understand the code handling user consent
+- Contribute improvements and fixes
+- Self-host for complete control
+- Trust through transparency
+
+### 2. Developer Experience 
+Privacy management should feel natural in your development workflow:
+
+- TypeScript-first APIs with full type safety
+- Modern React patterns and hooks
+- Intuitive state management
+- Comprehensive documentation
+
+### 3. Performance as Standard
+Every byte matters. c15t is built with performance in mind:
+
+- Minimal bundle impact
+- Efficient state management
+- Optimized server/client patterns
+- Smart code splitting
+
+### 4. Privacy by Design
+Privacy isn't an afterthought - it's a core part of modern web development:
+
+- GDPR-compliant by default
+- Granular consent controls
+- Complete audit trail
+- Privacy-first architecture

+title: API Reference
+description: Comprehensive guide to using the c15t package for managing privacy consents.
+---
+
+# Core Package API Reference
+
+The core package (`c15t`) provides the fundamental functionality for managing privacy consents in your application. This reference documents the main types, interfaces, and functions available in the package.
+
+## Store API
+
+The core package implements a robust state management system for handling privacy consents. The store provides methods for:
+
+- Managing consent states
+- Persisting consent data
+- Validating consent configurations
+
+For detailed implementation examples, refer to the [Getting Started](/docs/javascript/quickstart) guide.
+
+## Privacy Consent State
+
+The `PrivacyConsentState` type represents the current state of privacy consents in your application. It contains information about user preferences, consent categories, and their respective settings.
+
+<auto-type-table path="../../node_modules/c15t/src/index.ts" name="PrivacyConsentState" />
+
+## Consent Types
+
+The `ConsentType` type defines the structure of individual consent categories and their properties.
+
+<auto-type-table path="../../node_modules/c15t/src/index.ts" name="ConsentType" />
+
+ ## Translation Configuration
+
+The `defaultTranslationConfig` provides the default translation settings for the consent management interface.
+
+<auto-type-table path="../../node_modules/c15t/src/index.ts" name="TranslationConfig" /> 
+
+## Tracking Blocker Configuration
+
+The `TrackingBlockerConfig` type defines the configuration options for the tracking blocker functionality.
+
+<auto-type-table path="../../node_modules/c15t/src/index.ts" name="TrackingBlockerConfig" />

+  <h3>Congratulations, you've chosen the best way to deploy to production!</h3>
+  
+  consent.io provides a fully managed service that removes all the infrastructure complexity. You can focus on your application while we handle scaling, updates, and compliance monitoring. For organizations with specific requirements, we also offer [self-hosting](/docs/storing-consent/self-hosting) options.
+</Callout>
+
+[consent.io](https://consent.io) provides a fully managed consent management service, offering the easiest way to implement robust server-based consent storage with minimal setup and maintenance.
+
+## Key Benefits
+
+- **Zero Backend Maintenance** - No server setup or management required
+- **Automatic Updates** - Always running the latest version
+- **Built-in Scaling** - Handles traffic spikes without configuration
+- **Geographic Detection** - Built-in jurisdiction detection for compliance
+- **Analytics Dashboard** - Insights into consent patterns and compliance
+- **Cross-Device Sync** - Users maintain consistent consent status across all devices
+
+## Getting Started
+
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Create a consent.io Instance
+
+1. Sign up for a [consent.io](https://consent.io) account
+2. Create a new instance in the dashboard
+3. Configure your trusted origins (domains that can connect to your instance)
+4. Copy the provided backendURL (e.g., `https://your-instance.c15t.dev`)
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure Your Client
+
+Set up your frontend to use the consent.io instance:
+
+```tsx
+import { configureConsentManager, type ConsentManagerOptions } from 'c15t';
+
+export const c15tConfig = {
+	mode: 'c15t',
+	backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
+} satisfies ConsentManagerOptions;
+
+export const consentManager = configureConsentManager(c15tConfig);
+
+const showConsentBanner = consentManager.showConsentBanner();
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Test Your Integration
+
+1. Run your application
+2. Verify the showConsentBanner function returns a response
+3. Check the consent.io dashboard to confirm data is being recorded
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+<CompactCard 
+  href="/docs/nextjs/quickstart" 
+  icon={<RiFlashlightLine size={18} />}
+>
+  See the <code>Next.js Quickstart Guide</code> for more frontend integration details
+</CompactCard>
+
+## Alternative: Self-Hosting
+
+If you need complete control over your consent management infrastructure, you can self-host a c15t instance instead of using consent.io.
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+Self-hosting requires more setup and maintenance effort but gives you complete control over your data and infrastructure.

+  See the <code>Self-Hosting Guide</code> for detailed setup instructions
+</CompactCard>
+
+## Deployment Options
+
+### Docker Support
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+Docker support for c15t is not currently available out-of-the-box. We're interested in adding this feature and would welcome community contributions.
+</Callout>
+
+If you're interested in containerizing c15t for Docker deployments:
+
+- We don't currently provide official Docker images or Dockerfiles
+- This is on our roadmap but doesn't have a specific timeline
+- Community contributions for Docker support would be greatly appreciated
+- You can propose Docker implementations through our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/issues/162)
+
+Until official Docker support is available, we recommend using one of our existing deployment options:
+
+1. **consent.io (hosted)** - Zero setup, fully managed service
+2. **Self-hosting with Next.js API routes** - Integrated into your existing application
+3. **Standalone server** - Standard Node.js deployment
+
+## When to Use Hosted c15t
+
+Choose consent.io (hosted c15t) when:
+
+- You want the simplest implementation with minimal backend configuration
+- You prefer not to manage database setup and maintenance
+- You need geographic jurisdiction detection built-in
+- You want automatic updates and scaling
+
+Consider [Offline Mode](/nextjs/storing-consent/offline-mode) for simple applications without cross-device needs, or [Self-Hosting](/nextjs/storing-consent/self-hosting) for complete control.

+title: 'Offline Mode'
+description: 'Store consent decisions in the browser with offline mode, perfect for sites without backend requirements'
+---
+import { RiServerLine, RiGlobalLine, RiSettings4Line } from '@remixicon/react';
+
+The offline mode provides a simple, browser-based approach to storing user consent decisions without requiring a backend server.
+
+## Key Characteristics
+
+- **No backend required** - Everything is stored locally in the browser
+- **Simplified setup** - Get started quickly with minimal configuration
+- **Independence** - Works without external services or APIs
+- **Fast implementation** - Ideal for prototyping and simpler sites
+
+## Implementation
+
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Install the Package
+
+```package-install
+c15t
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure the Client (Svelte/JavaScript)
+
+Set up the c15t client with offline mode in your Svelte or JavaScript project:
+
+```ts
+// src/lib/c15t.client.ts
+import { configureConsentManager, type ConsentManagerOptions } from 'c15t';
+
+export const c15tConfig = {
+  mode: 'offline',
+  // Optional: Add callback functions for various events
+  callbacks: {
+    onConsentSet: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent has been saved locally');
+    },
+    onConsentBannerFetched: (response) => {
+      console.log('Banner state retrieved:', response.data);
+    },
+    onConsentVerified: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent verification complete');
+    },
+    onError: (error, endpoint) => {
+      console.error(`Error in ${endpoint}:`, error);
+    }
+  }
+} satisfies ConsentManagerOptions;
+
+export const consentManager = configureConsentManager(c15tConfig);
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Use the Consent Manager in Your App
+
+You can now use the `consentManager` instance in your Svelte components or JavaScript code:
+
+```ts
+<script lang="ts">
+  import { consentManager } from '../lib/c15t.client';
+
+  // Example: Show the consent banner if needed
+  let showBanner = false;
+
+  consentManager.showConsentBanner().then((result) => {
+    showBanner = result;
+  });
+</script>
+
+{#if showBanner}
+  <ConsentBanner />
+{/if}
+```
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## How It Works
+
+<Callout type="note">
+Offline mode provides the same API interface as the standard client but operates completely client-side.
+</Callout>
+
+The offline mode implements the same interface as the standard client, but with the following differences:
+
+1. **Storage**: All consent preferences are stored in the browser's localStorage using the configured key
+2. **Network**: No network requests are made, all operations happen locally
+3. **Consent Banner**: The banner visibility is determined by checking if a value exists in localStorage
+4. **Consent Verification**: Always returns a successful response
+
+## Configuration Options
+
+The offline mode accepts the following configuration options:
+
+```ts
+const options = {
+  mode: 'offline',
+  // Optional: Add callback functions for various events
+  callbacks: {
+    onConsentBannerFetched: (response) => {
+      console.log('Banner state retrieved:', response.data);
+    },
+    onConsentSet: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent preferences saved');
+    },
+    onConsentVerified: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent verification complete');
+    },
+    onError: (error, endpoint) => {
+      console.error(`Error in ${endpoint}:`, error);
+    }
+  }
+};
+```
+
+## Storage Mechanisms
+
+In offline mode, consent decisions are stored in the browser using:
+
+### LocalStorage
+
+By default, c15t uses the browser's localStorage to persist consent decisions:
+
+```ts
+// Default implementation
+import { configureConsentManager } from 'c15t';
+
+export const consentManager = configureConsentManager({
+  mode: 'offline',
+  storage: 'localStorage' // This is the default, so can be omitted
+});
+```
+
+### SessionStorage
+
+For session-based consent that's cleared when the browser is closed:
+
+```ts
+import { configureConsentManager } from 'c15t';
+
+export const consentManager = configureConsentManager({
+  mode: 'offline',
+  storage: 'sessionStorage'
+});
+```
+
+### Memory Only
+
+For applications where persistence isn't needed:
+
+```ts
+import { configureConsentManager } from 'c15t';
+
+export const consentManager = configureConsentManager({
+  mode: 'offline',
+  storage: 'memory'
+});
+```
+
+## Browser Compatibility
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+Some browser environments like private browsing modes may have localStorage restrictions.
+</Callout>
+
+The offline mode relies on localStorage, which is supported in all modern browsers. However, it includes fallbacks for environments where localStorage might be unavailable or restricted:
+
+- Private browsing modes in some browsers
+- Cookie-blocking browser extensions
+- Browsers with storage permissions disabled
+
+In these cases, the client will log a warning and continue functioning with defaults.
+
+## Use Cases
+
+### Development and Testing
+
+Offline mode is perfect for development and testing environments where you don't want to set up a backend:
+
+```ts
+const options = {
+  mode: import.meta.env.MODE === 'development' 
+    ? 'offline' 
+    : 'c15t',
+  backendURL: import.meta.env.MODE === 'production'
+    ? import.meta.env.VITE_C15T_URL
+    : undefined
+};
+```
+
+### Static Sites
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+Offline mode is an excellent choice for static sites deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
+</Callout>
+
+For static sites without backend integration, offline mode provides a simple solution:
+
+```ts
+const options = {
+  mode: 'offline',
+};
+```
+
+### Fallback Mode
+
+You can use offline mode as a fallback when the backend is unavailable:
+
+```ts
+import { onMount } from 'svelte';
+import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
+import { configureConsentManager } from 'c15t';
+
+const mode = writable<'c15t' | 'offline'>('c15t');
+
+onMount(() => {
+  fetch('/api/c15t/status')
+    .catch(() => {
+      console.warn('c15t backend unavailable, switching to offline mode');
+      mode.set('offline');
+    });
+});
+
+const options = {
+  mode,
+  backendURL: $mode === 'c15t' ? '/api/c15t' : undefined
+};
+
+export const consentManager = configureConsentManager(options);
+```
+
+## Limitations
+
+<Callout type="important">
+Understand these limitations when deciding if offline mode is right for your application.
+</Callout>
+
+While offline mode provides a functional consent management solution, it has some limitations:
+
+1. **No Centralized Reporting**: Since all data is stored locally, you can't generate reports or analytics
+2. **Device-Specific**: Consent preferences don't transfer between devices or browsers
+3. **Storage Limits**: localStorage has size limitations (typically 5-10MB per domain)
+4. **No Server-Side Logic**: Custom server-side processing of consent isn't possible
+
+## When to Use Offline Mode
+
+Consider using offline mode when:
+
+- You're building a prototype or MVP
+- Your site doesn't have a backend
+- You want the simplest possible implementation
+- Cross-device synchronization isn't a requirement
+- You have limited compliance needs
+
+For more complex applications or those with stricter compliance requirements, consider [hosted c15t](/docs/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) instead.

+
+### Offline Mode
+
+Store consent decisions entirely in the browser without any server:
+
+- Zero backend requirements
+- Simplest implementation
+- Works offline and in statically-hosted sites
+- Perfect for development or simple use cases
+
+## Decision Guide
+
+<Callout>
+Use this decision tree to determine which storage option best fits your needs.
+</Callout>
+
+1. **Do you need consent data to persist across devices?**
+   - No → Consider **Offline Mode**
+   - Yes → Continue to question 2
+
+2. **Do you need complete control over your consent data?**
+   - No → Use **Hosted c15t** (consent.io)
+   - Yes → Continue to question 3
+
+3. **Do you have an existing consent management system?**
+   - No → Use **Self-Hosting**
+   - Yes → Consider **Custom Client**
+
+## Creating a Client
+
+The main factory function `configureConsentManager` creates the appropriate client implementation based on the provided options:
+
+```tsx
+import { configureConsentManager, type ConsentManagerOptions } from 'c15t';
+
+export const c15tConfig = {
+	mode: 'c15t',
+	backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
+} satisfies ConsentManagerOptions;
+
+const consentManager = configureConsentManager(c15tConfig);
+```
+
+## Global Callback Events
+
+All client modes support the following callback events:
+
+```tsx
+const callbacks = {
+  // Called when any request fails
+  onError: (response, path) => {
+    console.error(`Request to ${path} failed:`, response.error);
+  },
+

+## When to Use Each Mode
+
+<Callout>
+  Choosing the right mode depends on your specific requirements and constraints.
+</Callout>
+
+- **c15t Mode**: For production applications with a real c15t backend
+- **Offline Mode**: For production applications with your own backend systems, or when you want to eliminate external service dependencies
+- **Custom Mode**: When you need to integrate with an existing consent system but still want to implement custom HTTP request handling
+
+## What's Next
+
+Choose the storage approach that best fits your needs:
+
+- [Hosted c15t](/docs/javascript/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) - Use consent.io for a managed solution
+- [Self-Hosting](/docs/javascript/storing-consent/self-hosting) - Run your own c15t instance
+- [Offline Mode](/docs/javascript/storing-consent/offline-mode) - Store consent in the browser

+description: 'Set up and maintain your own c15t instance for full control over your consent management backend'
+---
+
+import { RiGlobalLine, RiTimerLine, RiSettings4Line, RiDatabase2Line, RiCodeLine } from '@remixicon/react';
+
+This guide shows you how to set up a self-hosted c15t instance, giving you complete control over your consent management system.
+
+<Callout type="info">
+Looking for an easier way? [consent.io](https://consent.io) offers a fully managed c15t backend with minimal setup. See the [hosted c15t](/docs/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) page for details.
+</Callout>
+
+
+<Steps>
+
+<Step>
+### Install `@c15t/backend` Package
+ 
+```package-install
+@c15t/backend
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Create a c15t instance
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+Separating your configuration from the API route handler makes it easier to manage and update your c15t instance.
+</Callout>
+
+First, create a separate file for your c15t instance configuration:
+
+<Tabs items={['Memory', 'Kysely', 'Prisma', 'Drizzle']}>
+<Tab value="Memory">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { memoryAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/memory-adapter';
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: memoryAdapter({}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+This example uses the Memory Adapter for simple in-memory storage that's perfect for development and testing. Data is stored in RAM and doesn't persist when the server restarts.
+</Tab>
+
+<Tab value="Kysely">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { kyselyAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/kysely-adapter';
+import { PostgresDialect } from 'kysely';
+import pg from 'pg';
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: kyselyAdapter({
+		dialect: new PostgresDialect({
+			pool: new pg.Pool({
+				host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
+				port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432'),
+				database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'c15t',
+				user: process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres',
+				password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '',
+			}),
+		}),
+	}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+
+This configuration uses the Kysely adapter with PostgreSQL. The Kysely adapter provides a type-safe SQL query builder that works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, offering excellent performance with minimal overhead.
+</Tab>
+
+<Tab value="Prisma">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { prismaAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/prisma-adapter';
+import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
+
+const prisma = new PrismaClient();
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: prismaAdapter({
+		client: prisma,
+	}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+
+This setup integrates Prisma ORM to provide a feature-rich database interface with automatic migrations, relationship handling, and excellent TypeScript integration.
+</Tab>
+
+<Tab value="Drizzle">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { drizzleAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/drizzle-adapter';
+import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
+import postgres from 'postgres';
+
+const client = postgres(`postgres://${process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres'}:${process.env.DB_PASSWORD || ''}@${process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost'}:${process.env.DB_PORT || '5432'}/${process.env.DB_NAME || 'c15t'}`);
+const db = drizzle(client);
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: drizzleAdapter({
+		client: db,
+	}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+
+This example uses the lightweight Drizzle ORM that focuses on performance and type safety with minimal abstractions. It's ideal for projects that need direct SQL access with TypeScript support.
+</Tab>
+</Tabs>
+
+Then, create a catch-all API route that imports and uses this instance:
+
+```tsx title="app/api/c15t/[...all]/route.ts"
+import { toNextHandler } from '@c15t/backend/integrations/next';
+import { instance } from '../c15t';
+
+export const { GET, POST, OPTIONS } = toNextHandler(instance);
+```
+
+<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Cloudflare']}>
+<Tab value="Next.js">
+```tsx title="app/api/c15t/[...all]/route.ts"
+import { toNextHandler } from '@c15t/backend/integrations/next';
+import { instance } from '../c15t';
+
+export const { GET, POST, OPTIONS } = toNextHandler(instance);
+```
+</Tab>
+<Tab value="Cloudflare">
+```tsx title="src/index.ts"
+import { toCloudflareHandler } from '@c15t/backend/integrations/cloudflare';
+import { instance } from './c15t';
+
+const handler = toCloudflareHandler(instance);
+
+export default {
+	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
+		return handler(env)(request);
+	},
+};
+```
+</Tab>
+</Tabs>
+
+This approach separates your instance configuration from the route handler, making it easier for CLI tools and migration utilities to locate and work with your c15t instance.
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure Your App to Use the API Route
+
+Update your ConsentManagerOptions to point to your new API route:
+
+```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
+const options: ConsentManagerOptions = {
+	mode: 'c15t',
+	backendURL: 'http://localhost:8787', // Allows partial paths e.g. /api/c15t
+};
+```
+</Step>
+
+</Steps>
+
+## Database Options
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+For production use, the Memory Adapter is not recommended as data is lost when the server restarts.
+</Callout>
+
+For production use, you should consider using a persistent database. c15t supports several database adapters:

+title: Google Tag Manager (Unstable)
+description: Learn how to integrate c15t with Google Tag Manager (GTM).
+---
+
+We're working on a beta version of the Google Tag Manager integration.
+c15t will automatically inject the GTM script into your page.
+
+<Steps> 
+<Step>
+### Creating a Tag Manager Container
+
+<Callout type="note">
+This step is optional if you already have a Tag Manager container. Ensure your container has consent overview enabled.
+</Callout>
+
+After signing into Google Tag Manager, you can create a new container.
+[Continue to Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/)
+
+1. In Tag Manager, click Admin > Container Settings.
+2. Under Additional Settings, select "Enable consent overview".
+
+![Enable consent overview](../react/assets/container-settings.png)
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Setting up c15t with Google Tag Manager
+
+After creating your container, you can set up c15t with Google Tag Manager.
+
+All you need to do copy and paste your container ID into the `unstable_googleTagManager.id` property.
+
+This begins with "GTM-". 
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerProvider
+  options={{
+    mode: 'c15t',
+    backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
+    unstable_googleTagManager: {
+      id: 'GTM-XXXXXXX',
+    },
+  }}
+>
+```
+
+If you have GTM in your site already, you can remove the GTM script from your head section.
+
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+### All Done!
+
+c15t will automatically inject the GTM script into your page and update the consent state in GTM.
+

+In every page you want to pre-fetch the data server-side, you can use the `withInitialC15TData` helper. Otherwise, it will be fetched client-side.
+
+```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
+import { withInitialC15TData } from '@c15t/nextjs';
+
+// This helper accepts a 2nd argument to wrap around your getServerSideProps existing function.

+
+<Callout type="tip">
+  If you're using Next.js Rewrites, you can use the `backendURL` option to redirect requests to the c15t backend by setting it to `/api/c15t`.

+## Hosting Options
+
+### Creating a consent.io Instance (Recommended)
+
+<Callout type="info">
+Using consent.io is the recommended method as it is the easiest way to get started and requires little maintenance.
+</Callout>
+
+Instead of self-hosting your own c15t instance, you can use a [consent.io](https://consent.io) instance. This is the recommended method as it is the easiest way to get started and requires little maintenance.
+
+<Steps>
+
+<Step>
+Sign up for a [consent.io](https://consent.io) account.
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+After signing up, create a new instance, located in the top-right corner.
+
+<Callout>
+When creating an instance it is important to list all the trusted origins for your application such as "localhost", "vercel.app", "c15t.com" etc.
+</Callout>
+
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+After the instance is created, you will be given a backendURL, which you can add to your `ConsentManagerOptions`.
+
+
+A backend URL might look like this: `https://<my-instance>.c15t.dev/`.

+## Full License
+
+_Version 3, 29 June 2007_  
+_Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. [fsf.org](http://fsf.org/)_
+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
+document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+## Preamble
+
+The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other
+kinds of works.
+
+The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away
+your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a
+program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
+Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
+applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
+Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
+copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source
+code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
+it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
+
+To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or
+asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if
+you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to
+respect the freedom of others.
+
+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,
+you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make
+sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
+terms so they know their rights.
+
+Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** assert
+copyright on the software, and **(2)** offer you this License giving you legal permission
+to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
+
+For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is
+no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL
+requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not
+be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
+
+Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of
+the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally
+incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
+this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems
+arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to
+those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
+users.
+
+Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should
+not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose
+computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
+applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the
+GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
+
+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
+
+## TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+### 0. Definitions
+
+"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
+
+"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
+works, such as semiconductor masks.
+
+"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
+License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
+"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
+
+To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in
+a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The
+resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a
+work "based on" the earlier work.
+
+A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
+the Program.
+
+To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
+applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
+copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
+making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
+
+To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
+parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
+network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
+
+An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
+extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that **(1)**
+displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)** tells the user that there is no
+warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that
+licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
+License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
+
+### 1. Source Code
+
+The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
+work.
+
+A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
+specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among
+developers working in that language.
+
+The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
+the work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
+Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and **(b)** serves only to
+enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
+Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.
+A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which
+the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
+interpreter used to run it.
+
+The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
+source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
+code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,
+it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
+generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those
+activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
+includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and
+the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
+is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or
+control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
+
+The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
+automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
+
+The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
+
+### 2. Basic Permissions
+
+All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the
+Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License
+explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The
+output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
+given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights
+of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
+
+You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
+conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered
+works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively
+for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you
+comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
+control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
+exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
+them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
+with you.
+
+Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
+stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
+
+### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law
+
+No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any
+applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty
+adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention
+of such measures.
+
+When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of
+technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising
+rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
+intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
+against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention
+of technological measures.
+
+### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies
+
+You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any
+medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and
+any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep
+intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of
+this License along with the Program.
+
+You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer
+support or warranty protection for a fee.
+
+### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions
+
+You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from
+the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that
+you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a
+relevant date.
+* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this
+License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the
+requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
+* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
+comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any
+applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
+regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the
+work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
+separately received it.
+* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal
+Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display
+Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
+
+A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are
+not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with
+it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
+medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
+copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
+beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate
+does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
+
+### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms
+
+You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and
+5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the
+terms of this License, in one of these ways:
+
+* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
+physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a
+durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
+* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
+physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least
+three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for
+that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a copy of
+the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this
+License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for
+a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of
+source, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
+charge.
+* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to
+provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and
+noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in
+accord with subsection 6b.
+* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for
+a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way
+through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy
+the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object
+code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
+(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,
+provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find
+the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,
+you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy
+these requirements.
+* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform
+other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being
+offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
+
+A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
+Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
+object code work.
+
+A "User Product" is either **(1)** a "consumer product", which
+means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
+household purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation into a
+dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases
+shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a
+particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of
+that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
+in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
+product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
+substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
+the only significant mode of use of the product.
+
+"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
+modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of
+its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
+functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
+solely because modification has been made.
+
+If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for
+use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which
+the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient
+in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
+characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
+accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
+neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code
+on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
+
+The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to
+continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been
+modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
+modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself
+materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules
+and protocols for communication across the network.
+
+Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with
+this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
+implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no
+special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
+
+### 7. Additional Terms
+
+"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
+permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they
+were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
+law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
+used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
+this License without regard to the additional permissions.
+
+When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
+additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
+permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you
+modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a
+covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
+
+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
+covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
+supplement the terms of this License with terms:
+
+* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
+sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
+* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
+attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works
+containing it; or
+* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that
+modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the
+original version; or
+* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the
+material; or
+* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
+trademarks, or service marks; or
+* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone
+who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of
+liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions
+directly impose on those licensors and authors.
+
+All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
+restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received
+it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License
+along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
+license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
+under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of
+that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
+relicensing or conveying.
+
+If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in
+the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those
+files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
+
+Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
+separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
+either way.
+
+### 8. Termination
+
+You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
+this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
+automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses
+granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
+
+However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
+particular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until the
+copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently,
+if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
+prior to 60 days after the cessation.
+
+Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently
+if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this
+is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any
+work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
+your receipt of the notice.
+
+Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
+parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
+rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to
+receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
+
+### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies
+
+You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the
+Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of
+using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
+acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
+propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not
+accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you
+indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
+
+### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients
+
+Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license
+from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this
+License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
+License.
+
+An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or
+merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity
+transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
+receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
+could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor
+has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
+
+You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or
+affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,
+or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
+initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
+that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or
+importing the Program or any portion of it.
+
+### 11. Patents
+
+A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
+licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
+
+A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
+controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that
+would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or
+selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed
+only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
+purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent
+sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
+
+Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
+under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
+import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
+version.
+
+In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an
+express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent
+infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make
+such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
+
+If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
+Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge
+and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or
+other readily accessible means, then you must either **(1)** cause the Corresponding
+Source to be so available, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
+patent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner consistent with
+the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
+recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but
+for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your
+recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more
+identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
+
+If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
+convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent
+license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
+propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent
+license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and
+works based on it.
+
+A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
+scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
+non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this
+License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with
+a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make
+payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
+work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive
+the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license **(a)** in connection with
+copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)**
+primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain
+the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
+was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
+
+Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
+license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you
+under applicable patent law.
+
+### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom
+
+If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
+that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
+conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
+obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you
+agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
+those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms
+and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
+
+### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License
+
+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or
+combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero
+General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.
+The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
+work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section
+13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.
+
+### 14. Revised Versions of this License
+
+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
+General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit
+to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that
+a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later
+version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the
+Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU
+General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
+Software Foundation.
+
+If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU
+General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
+version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
+
+Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no
+additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of
+your choosing to follow a later version.
+
+### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty
+
+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
+EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
+QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+### 16. Limitation of Liability
+
+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
+COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
+PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
+INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
+OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
+WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16
+
+If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be
+given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local
+law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
+connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies
+a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
+
+_END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_
+
+## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to
+the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
+can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them
+to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;
+and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to
+where the full notice is found.
+
+    {`<program>`}  Copyright (C) {`<year>`}  {`<name of author>`}
+
+    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program.  If not, see [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    {`<program>`}  Copyright (C) {`<year>`}  {`<name of author>`}
+    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w` and `show c` should show the appropriate parts of
+the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different;
+for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to
+sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
+information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
+[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).
+
+The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it
+more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
+what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this
+License. But first, please read
+[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html).

+title: Building Privacy Tools in the Open
+description: We believe great developer tools should be built in the open, with transparency and community collaboration at their core. This philosophy guides how we're building modern privacy infrastructure.
+---
+
+## Open Source Foundation
+
+Consent Management (c15t) is built with a strong open source foundation:
+
+- **Core Platform**: GNU3 licensed, ensuring your privacy tools remain free and open
+- **UI Components**: Built on shadcn/ui, giving you complete customization control
+- **Server Components**: Full Next.js app directory support for modern applications
+- **Cloud Platform**: Optional managed service coming soon (while keeping core open source)
+
+## Why We Chose Open Source
+
+Privacy infrastructure should be:
+
+1. **Transparent**
+   - See exactly how user consent is managed
+   - Audit the code handling sensitive data
+   - Understand the complete data flow
+
+2. **Community-Driven**
+   - Benefit from collective expertise
+   - Shape the future of privacy tools
+   - Share best practices globally
+
+3. **Trustworthy**
+   - No black boxes in privacy management
+   - Full visibility into data handling
+   - Community-verified security
+
+4. **Flexible**
+   - Self-host for complete control
+   - Customize to your exact needs
+   - Integrate with your existing stack
+
+## Following Giants
+
+We're inspired by transformative developer platforms:
+
+- **Vercel**: Revolutionized deployment workflows
+- **Clerk**: Simplified authentication
+- **Resend**: Modernized email infrastructure
+- **Unkey**: Streamlined API key management
+
+Just as these platforms brought developer experience to the forefront, we're bringing that same level of excellence and simplicity to privacy management.
+
+## Our Commitment
+
+By choosing open source, we commit to:
+
+- **Transparency**: All core code is public and auditable
+- **Community**: Decisions made with community input
+- **Quality**: Enterprise-grade while remaining open
+- **Longevity**: Sustainable open source development
+

+title: Google Tag Manager (Unstable)
+description: Learn how to integrate c15t with Google Tag Manager (GTM).
+---
+
+We're working on a beta version of the Google Tag Manager integration.
+c15t will automatically inject the GTM script into your page.
+
+<Steps> 
+<Step>
+### Creating a Tag Manager Container
+
+<Callout type="note">
+This step is optional if you already have a Tag Manager container. Ensure your container has consent overview enabled.
+</Callout>
+
+After signing into Google Tag Manager, you can create a new container.
+[Continue to Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/)
+
+1. In Tag Manager, click Admin > Container Settings.
+2. Under Additional Settings, select "Enable consent overview".
+
+![Enable consent overview](./assets/container-settings.png)
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Setting up c15t with Google Tag Manager
+
+After creating your container, you can set up c15t with Google Tag Manager.
+
+All you need to do copy and paste your container ID into the `unstable_googleTagManager.id` property.
+
+This begins with "GTM-". 
+
+```tsx
+<ConsentManagerProvider
+  options={{
+    mode: 'c15t',
+    backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
+    unstable_googleTagManager: {
+      id: 'GTM-XXXXXXX',
+    },
+  }}
+>
+```
+
+If you have GTM in your site already, you can remove the GTM script from your head section.
+
+</Step>

+title: React Quickstart
+description: Learn how to integrate c15t into your React application with this step-by-step guide. We'll cover installation, configuration, and basic usage.
+---
+
+## CLI Setup (Recommended)
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Generate Schema + Code
+
+<RunCommand command="@c15t/cli generate" />
+
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Run Database Migrations (Optional)
+
+<Callout type="note">
+This is only required if you are self hosting c15t.
+</Callout>
+
+<RunCommand command="@c15t/cli migrate" />
+
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## Manual Setup
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Install `@c15t/react` Package
+ ```package-install
+ @c15t/react
+ ```
+</Step>
+ 
+<Step>
+ 
+### Add to Your React Application
+
+```tsx title="src/App.jsx"
+import { 
+  ConsentManagerDialog,
+  ConsentManagerProvider,
+  CookieBanner,
+  type ConsentManagerOptions
+} from '@c15t/react';
+
+function App() {
+  const options = {
+    mode: 'c15t', 
+    backendURL: process.env.REACT_APP_C15T_URL,
+    consentCategories: ['necessary', 'marketing'], // Optional: Specify which consent categories to show in the banner. 
+    ignoreGeoLocation: true, // Useful for development to always view the banner.
+  };
+
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
+      <div className="App">
+        {/* Your application content */}
+      </div>
+      <CookieBanner />
+      <ConsentManagerDialog />
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+
+export default App;
+```
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+You can create an instance at [consent.io](https://consent.io) (recommended) or use c15t offline by setting `mode: 'offline'`.
+</Callout>
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+--- 
+
+## Hosting Options
+
+### Creating a consent.io Instance (Recommended)
+
+<Callout type="info">
+Using consent.io is the recommended method as it is the easiest way to get started and requires little maintenance.
+</Callout>
+
+[consent.io](https://consent.io) provides a fully managed consent management service. This is the recommended method as it is the easiest way to get started and requires little maintenance.
+
+<Steps>
+
+<Step>
+Sign up for a [consent.io](https://consent.io) account.
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+After signing up, create a new instance, located in the top-right corner.
+
+<Callout>
+When creating an instance it is important to list all the trusted origins for your application such as "localhost", your production domain, etc.
+</Callout>
+
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+After the instance is created, you will be given a backendURL, which you can add to your `ConsentManagerOptions`.
+
+A backend URL might look like this: `https://<my-instance>.c15t.dev/`.
+</Step>
+
+</Steps>

+title: 'Custom Client'
+description: 'Implement your own consent storage solution with a custom client for ultimate flexibility and control'
+---
+import { RiServerLine, RiTimerLine, RiGlobalLine } from '@remixicon/react';
+
+The custom client mode gives you complete control over how consent decisions are stored and retrieved, allowing for integration with any storage backend or custom logic.
+
+## Key Characteristics
+
+- **Maximum flexibility** - Design a storage solution that meets your specific requirements
+- **Full integration** - Connect with existing user data systems or authentication services
+- **Complete control** - Implement custom caching, batching, or synchronization mechanisms
+- **Advanced use cases** - Support for complex scenarios like multi-tenant applications
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+The custom client mode is the most flexible but also the most complex implementation option. Only use it if you need complete control over consent handling.
+</Callout>
+
+## Implementation
+
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Install the Package
+
+```package-install
+@c15t/react
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Create Custom Endpoint Handlers
+
+<Callout type="note">
+You must implement all three core handlers: `showConsentBanner`, `setConsent`, and `verifyConsent`.
+</Callout>
+
+First, create handlers for the required endpoints:
+
+```tsx title="lib/consent-handlers.ts"
+import type {
+  SetConsentRequestBody,
+  SetConsentResponse,
+  ShowConsentBannerResponse,
+  VerifyConsentRequestBody,
+  VerifyConsentResponse,
+} from '@c15t/backend';
+import type { EndpointHandlers } from '@c15t/react';
+
+// Custom storage implementation (could be localStorage, IndexedDB, etc.)
+const consentStorage = {
+  getItem: (key: string) => {
+    if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null;
+    return localStorage.getItem(key);
+  },
+  setItem: (key: string, value: string) => {
+    if (typeof window === 'undefined') return;
+    localStorage.setItem(key, value);
+  }
+};
+
+export const createCustomHandlers = (): EndpointHandlers => {
+  return {
+    // Handler for checking if banner should be shown
+    showConsentBanner: async () => {
+      const hasConsent = Boolean(consentStorage.getItem('custom-consent'));
+      
+      return {
+        data: {
+          showConsentBanner: !hasConsent,
+          jurisdiction: { code: 'EU', message: 'European Union' },
+          location: { countryCode: 'DE', regionCode: null }
+        },
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    },
+    
+    // Handler for saving consent preferences
+    setConsent: async (options) => {
+      const body = options?.body as SetConsentRequestBody;
+      
+      // Store the consent preferences
+      consentStorage.setItem(
+        'custom-consent',
+        JSON.stringify({
+          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
+          preferences: body?.preferences || {},
+        })
+      );
+      
+      return {
+        data: { success: true },
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    },
+    
+    // Handler for verifying consent
+    verifyConsent: async (options) => {
+      const body = options?.body as VerifyConsentRequestBody;
+      const storedConsent = consentStorage.getItem('custom-consent');
+      
+      // Parse stored consent or create default response
+      let response: VerifyConsentResponse = {
+        valid: false,
+        requiredConsent: body?.requiredConsent || [],
+        missingConsent: body?.requiredConsent || []
+      };
+      
+      if (storedConsent) {
+        const parsedConsent = JSON.parse(storedConsent);
+        const preferences = parsedConsent.preferences || {};
+        
+        // Check if all required consent items are present and accepted
+        const missingConsent = (body?.requiredConsent || []).filter(
+          item => !preferences[item] || preferences[item] !== true
+        );
+        
+        response = {
+          valid: missingConsent.length === 0,
+          requiredConsent: body?.requiredConsent || [],
+          missingConsent
+        };
+      }
+      
+      return {
+        data: response,
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    }
+  };
+};
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure the Provider with Custom Client
+
+```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
+import { 
+  ConsentManagerDialog,
+  ConsentManagerProvider,
+  CookieBanner,
+  type ConsentManagerOptions
+} from '@c15t/react';
+import { createCustomHandlers } from '../lib/consent-handlers';
+
+export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
+  const options: ConsentManagerOptions = {
+    mode: 'custom',
+    endpointHandlers: createCustomHandlers(),
+    // Optional event callbacks
+    callbacks: {
+      onConsentSet: (response) => {
+        console.log('Consent has been saved');
+      }
+    }
+  };
+
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
+      {children}
+      <CookieBanner />
+      <ConsentManagerDialog />
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+```
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## Custom Handler Interface
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+Each handler must return a Promise that resolves to a `ResponseContext` object with the appropriate data structure.
+</Callout>
+
+Each handler function must implement the `EndpointHandler` interface, which returns a Promise resolving to a `ResponseContext` object:
+
+```tsx
+type EndpointHandler<ResponseType, BodyType, QueryType> = (
+  options?: FetchOptions<ResponseType, BodyType, QueryType>
+) => Promise<ResponseContext<ResponseType>>;
+
+interface ResponseContext<T> {
+  data: T | null;
+  error: {
+    message: string;
+    status: number;
+    code: string;
+    cause?: unknown;
+  } | null;
+  ok: boolean;
+  response: Response | null;
+}
+```
+
+## Required Endpoint Handlers
+
+Your custom client must implement three core endpoint handlers:
+
+### 1. showConsentBanner
+
+Determines if the consent banner should be displayed to the user.
+
+```tsx
+showConsentBanner: EndpointHandler<ShowConsentBannerResponse>;
+
+// Return type structure
+interface ShowConsentBannerResponse {
+  showConsentBanner: boolean;
+  jurisdiction: {
+    code: string;
+    message: string;
+  };
+  location: {
+    countryCode: string;
+    regionCode: string | null;
+  };
+}
+```
+
+### 2. setConsent
+
+Saves user consent preferences.
+
+```tsx
+setConsent: EndpointHandler<SetConsentResponse, SetConsentRequestBody>;
+
+// Request body structure
+interface SetConsentRequestBody {
+  preferences: Record<string, boolean>;
+  // Additional custom fields can be included
+}
+
+// Response structure
+interface SetConsentResponse {
+  success: boolean;
+}
+```
+
+### 3. verifyConsent
+
+Checks if existing consent meets required criteria.
+
+```tsx
+verifyConsent: EndpointHandler<VerifyConsentResponse, VerifyConsentRequestBody>;
+
+// Request body structure
+interface VerifyConsentRequestBody {
+  requiredConsent: string[];
+}
+
+// Response structure
+interface VerifyConsentResponse {
+  valid: boolean;
+  requiredConsent: string[];
+  missingConsent: string[];
+}
+```
+
+## Advanced Features
+
+### Dynamic Handlers
+
+<Callout>
+Dynamic handlers allow you to extend the client's functionality beyond the core consent operations.
+</Callout>
+
+You can register additional custom endpoint handlers for specialized functionality:
+
+```tsx
+import { useConsentManager } from '@c15t/react';
+
+function MyComponent() {
+  const { client } = useConsentManager();
+  
+  useEffect(() => {
+    if (client && 'registerHandler' in client) {
+      // Register a custom endpoint handler
+      client.registerHandler('customEndpoint', async (options) => {
+        // Custom implementation
+        return {
+          data: { customData: 'example' },
+          error: null,
+          ok: true,
+          response: null
+        };
+      });
+    }
+  }, [client]);
+  
+  return <div>My component</div>;
+}
+```
+
+### Error Handling
+
+<Callout type="important">
+Proper error handling is essential for custom clients to ensure your application behaves predictably.
+</Callout>
+
+Custom handlers should handle errors and return appropriate response contexts:
+
+```tsx
+const errorHandler: EndpointHandler = async () => {
+  try {
+    // Operation that might fail
+    throw new Error('Something went wrong');
+  } catch (error) {
+    return {
+      data: null,
+      error: {
+        message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
+        status: 500,
+        code: 'CUSTOM_ERROR',
+        cause: error
+      },
+      ok: false,
+      response: null
+    };
+  }
+};
+```
+
+### Integration with External Systems
+
+Custom clients can seamlessly integrate with third-party consent management systems:
+
+```tsx
+const createThirdPartyHandlers = (): EndpointHandlers => {
+  return {
+    showConsentBanner: async () => {
+      // Call third-party API to check if banner should be shown
+      const response = await thirdPartyClient.checkConsentStatus();
+      
+      return {
+        data: {
+          showConsentBanner: response.needsConsent,
+          jurisdiction: { code: response.region, message: response.regionName },
+          location: { countryCode: response.country, regionCode: null }
+        },
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    },
+    
+    // Other handlers...
+  };
+};
+```
+
+## Use Cases
+
+### Integration with Existing Systems
+
+<Callout type="note">
+If your organization already has a consent management system, custom handlers provide a bridge between it and c15t's UI components.
+</Callout>
+
+```tsx
+// Integrate with an existing in-house consent system
+const createIntegrationHandlers = (): EndpointHandlers => {
+  return {
+    showConsentBanner: async () => {
+      const consentStatus = await existingConsentSystem.getStatus();
+      return {
+        data: {
+          showConsentBanner: consentStatus.requiresBanner,
+          jurisdiction: consentStatus.jurisdiction,
+          location: consentStatus.location
+        },
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    },
+    
+    // Other handlers
+  };
+};
+```
+
+### A/B Testing Consent Flows
+
+```tsx
+// Create handlers for A/B testing different consent UIs
+const createABTestHandlers = (): EndpointHandlers => {
+  // Randomly assign user to test group
+  const testGroup = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'A' : 'B';
+  
+  return {
+    showConsentBanner: async () => {
+      // Log the test group for analytics
+      analytics.logGroup(testGroup);
+      
+      return {
+        data: {
+          showConsentBanner: true,
+          jurisdiction: { code: 'EU', message: 'European Union' },
+          location: { countryCode: 'DE', regionCode: null },
+          // Include test group in the response data
+          testGroup
+        },
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    },
+    
+    // Other handlers
+  };
+};
+```
+
+### Hybrid Storage Approach
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+A hybrid approach can give you the best of both worlds: local storage for reliability and remote storage for analytics.
+</Callout>
+
+```tsx
+// Store data both locally and remotely when connection is available
+const createHybridHandlers = (): EndpointHandlers => {
+  return {
+    setConsent: async (options) => {
+      const body = options?.body;
+      
+      // Always save locally first
+      localStorage.setItem('hybrid-consent', JSON.stringify({
+        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
+        preferences: body?.preferences
+      }));
+      
+      // Try to save remotely if online
+      if (navigator.onLine) {
+        try {
+          await fetch('/api/external-consent', {
+            method: 'POST',
+            body: JSON.stringify(body)
+          });
+        } catch (error) {
+          // Queue for retry later
+          const queue = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sync-queue') || '[]');
+          queue.push({ type: 'setConsent', data: body });
+          localStorage.setItem('sync-queue', JSON.stringify(queue));
+        }
+      }
+      
+      return {
+        data: { success: true },
+        error: null,
+        ok: true,
+        response: null
+      };
+    },
+    
+    // Other handlers
+  };
+};
+```
+
+### With External Consent Management Platform
+
+```tsx
+export const externalCMPStorage = {
+  async getConsent(consentId) {
+    // Map to your CMP's purpose ID if needed
+    const purposeId = mapToPurposeId(consentId);
+    return externalCMP.getPurposeConsent(purposeId);
+  },
+  
+  async getConsents() {
+    // Get all consents from external CMP
+    const purposes = await externalCMP.getAllPurposeConsents();
+    
+    // Transform to c15t format
+    return purposes.map(purpose => ({
+      id: mapFromPurposeId(purpose.id),
+      status: purpose.consent,
+      timestamp: purpose.timestamp
+    }));
+  },
+  
+  async setConsent(consentId, value) {
+    const purposeId = mapToPurposeId(consentId);
+    await externalCMP.setPurposeConsent(purposeId, value.status);
+    return { success: true };
+  }
+};
+
+function mapToPurposeId(c15tId) {
+  const mapping = {
+    'marketing': 'purpose-1',
+    'analytics': 'purpose-2',
+    // Add your mappings
+  };
+  return mapping[c15tId] || c15tId;
+}
+
+function mapFromPurposeId(purposeId) {
+  const mapping = {
+    'purpose-1': 'marketing',
+    'purpose-2': 'analytics',
+    // Add your mappings
+  };
+  return mapping[purposeId] || purposeId;
+}
+```
+
+## When to Use Custom Client
+
+Consider using the custom client mode when:
+
+- You need to integrate with an existing user data system
+- You have complex consent storage requirements
+- You want to implement advanced features like batching or caching
+- You're integrating with an external consent management platform
+- You need to support multi-tenant applications
+- You're implementing a hybrid online/offline strategy
+
+For simpler use cases, consider [Hosted Solution](/docs/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) or [Offline Mode](/nextjs/storing-consent/offline-mode) instead.

+
+## Getting Started
+
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Create a consent.io Instance
+
+1. Sign up for a [consent.io](https://consent.io) account
+2. Create a new instance in the dashboard
+3. Configure your trusted origins (domains that can connect to your instance)
+4. Copy the provided backendURL (e.g., `https://your-instance.c15t.dev`)
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure Your Client
+
+Set up your frontend to use the consent.io instance:
+
+```tsx
+// app/layout.tsx
+import { 
+  ConsentManagerDialog,
+  ConsentManagerProvider,
+  CookieBanner
+} from '@c15t/react';
+
+export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
+  const options = {
+    mode: 'c15t',
+    backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
+  };
+
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
+      {children}
+      <CookieBanner />
+      <ConsentManagerDialog />
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Test Your Integration
+
+1. Run your application
+2. Verify the consent banner appears 
+3. Check the consent.io dashboard to confirm data is being recorded
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## Client Configuration
+
+Configure your frontend to connect to consent.io:
+
+```tsx
+const options = {
+  // Required: Set to 'c15t' mode for hosted services
+  mode: 'c15t',
+
+  // Required: URL to your consent.io instance
+  backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
+  
+  
+  // Optional: Global event callbacks
+  callbacks: {
+    onError: (response, path) => {
+      console.error(`Request to ${path} failed:`, response.error);
+    },
+    onConsentSet: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent set successfully');
+    }
+  }
+};
+```
+
+<CompactCard

+  icon={<RiFlashlightLine size={18} />}
+>
+  See the <code>Next.js Quickstart Guide</code> for more frontend integration details
+</CompactCard>
+
+## Alternative: Self-Hosting
+
+If you need complete control over your consent management infrastructure, you can self-host a c15t instance instead of using consent.io.
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+Self-hosting requires more setup and maintenance effort but gives you complete control over your data and infrastructure.

+  icon={<RiServerLine size={18} />}
+>
+  See the <code>Self-Hosting Guide</code> for detailed setup instructions
+</CompactCard>
+
+## Deployment Options
+
+### Docker Support
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+Docker support for c15t is not currently available out-of-the-box. We're interested in adding this feature and would welcome community contributions.
+</Callout>
+
+If you're interested in containerizing c15t for Docker deployments:
+
+- We don't currently provide official Docker images or Dockerfiles
+- This is on our roadmap but doesn't have a specific timeline
+- Community contributions for Docker support would be greatly appreciated
+- You can propose Docker implementations through our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/issues/162)
+
+Until official Docker support is available, we recommend using one of our existing deployment options:
+
+1. **consent.io (hosted)** - Zero setup, fully managed service
+2. **Self-hosting with Next.js API routes** - Integrated into your existing application
+3. **Standalone server** - Standard Node.js deployment
+
+## When to Use Hosted c15t
+
+Choose consent.io (hosted c15t) when:
+
+- You want the simplest implementation with minimal backend configuration
+- You prefer not to manage database setup and maintenance
+- You need geographic jurisdiction detection built-in
+- You want automatic updates and scaling
+
+Consider [Offline Mode](/nextjs/storing-consent/offline-mode) for simple applications without cross-device needs, or [Self-Hosting](/nextjs/storing-consent/self-hosting) for complete control.

+title: 'Offline Mode'
+description: 'Store consent decisions in the browser with offline mode, perfect for sites without backend requirements'
+---
+import { RiServerLine, RiGlobalLine, RiSettings4Line } from '@remixicon/react';
+
+The offline mode provides a simple, browser-based approach to storing user consent decisions without requiring a backend server.
+
+## Key Characteristics
+
+- **No backend required** - Everything is stored locally in the browser
+- **Simplified setup** - Get started quickly with minimal configuration
+- **Independence** - Works without external services or APIs
+- **Fast implementation** - Ideal for prototyping and simpler sites
+
+## Implementation
+
+<Steps>
+<Step>
+### Install the Package
+
+```package-install
+@c15t/react
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure the Client
+
+Set up the c15t client with offline mode:
+
+```jsx
+// lib/c15tClient.js
+import { createClient } from '@c15t/react'
+
+export const c15tClient = createClient({
+  mode: 'offline',
+})
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Add the Provider
+
+Wrap your application with the ConsentManagerProvider:
+
+```jsx
+import { ConsentManagerProvider } from '@c15t/react'
+import { c15tClient } from '../lib/c15tClient'
+
+function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider options={c15tClient}>
+      <Component {...pageProps} />
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  )
+}
+
+export default MyApp
+```
+</Step>
+</Steps>
+
+## How It Works
+
+<Callout type="note">
+Offline mode provides the same API interface as the standard client but operates completely client-side.
+</Callout>
+
+The offline mode implements the same interface as the standard client, but with the following differences:
+
+1. **Storage**: All consent preferences are stored in the browser's localStorage using the configured key
+2. **Network**: No network requests are made, all operations happen locally
+3. **Consent Banner**: The banner visibility is determined by checking if a value exists in localStorage
+4. **Consent Verification**: Always returns a successful response
+
+## Configuration Options
+
+The offline mode accepts the following configuration options:
+
+```jsx
+const options = {
+  mode: 'offline',
+  // Optional: Add callback functions for various events
+  callbacks: {
+    onConsentBannerFetched: (response) => {
+      console.log('Banner state retrieved:', response.data);
+    },
+    onConsentSet: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent preferences saved');
+    },
+    onConsentVerified: (response) => {
+      console.log('Consent verification complete');
+    },
+    onError: (error, endpoint) => {
+      console.error(`Error in ${endpoint}:`, error);
+    }
+  }
+};
+```
+
+## Storage Mechanisms
+
+In offline mode, consent decisions are stored in the browser using:
+
+### LocalStorage
+
+By default, c15t uses the browser's localStorage to persist consent decisions:
+
+```jsx
+// Default implementation
+export const c15tClient = createClient({
+  mode: 'offline',
+  storage: 'localStorage' // This is the default, so can be omitted
+})
+```
+
+### SessionStorage
+
+For session-based consent that's cleared when the browser is closed:
+
+```jsx
+export const c15tClient = createClient({
+  mode: 'offline',
+  storage: 'sessionStorage'
+})
+```
+
+### Memory Only
+
+For applications where persistence isn't needed:
+
+```jsx
+export const c15tClient = createClient({
+  mode: 'offline',
+  storage: 'memory'
+})
+```
+
+## Browser Compatibility
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+Some browser environments like private browsing modes may have localStorage restrictions.
+</Callout>
+
+The offline mode relies on localStorage, which is supported in all modern browsers. However, it includes fallbacks for environments where localStorage might be unavailable or restricted:
+
+- Private browsing modes in some browsers
+- Cookie-blocking browser extensions
+- Browsers with storage permissions disabled
+
+In these cases, the client will log a warning and continue functioning with defaults.
+
+## Use Cases
+
+### Development and Testing
+
+Offline mode is perfect for development and testing environments where you don't want to set up a backend:
+
+```jsx
+// Development configuration
+const options = {
+  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' 
+    ? 'offline' 
+    : 'c15t',
+  backendURL: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
+    ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_C15T_URL
+    : undefined
+};
+```
+
+### Static Sites
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+Offline mode is an excellent choice for static sites deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
+</Callout>
+
+For static sites without backend integration, offline mode provides a simple solution:
+
+```jsx
+const options = {
+  mode: 'offline',
+};
+```
+
+### Fallback Mode
+
+You can use offline mode as a fallback when the backend is unavailable:
+
+```jsx
+import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
+
+function ConsentProvider({ children }) {
+  const [mode, setMode] = useState('c15t');
+  
+  useEffect(() => {
+    // Check if backend is available
+    fetch('/api/c15t/status')
+      .catch(() => {
+        console.warn('c15t backend unavailable, switching to offline mode');
+        setMode('offline');
+      });
+  }, []);
+  
+  const options = {
+    mode,
+    backendURL: mode === 'c15t' ? '/api/c15t' : undefined
+  };
+  
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
+      {children}
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+```
+
+## Limitations
+
+<Callout type="important">
+Understand these limitations when deciding if offline mode is right for your application.
+</Callout>
+
+While offline mode provides a functional consent management solution, it has some limitations:
+
+1. **No Centralized Reporting**: Since all data is stored locally, you can't generate reports or analytics
+2. **Device-Specific**: Consent preferences don't transfer between devices or browsers
+3. **Storage Limits**: localStorage has size limitations (typically 5-10MB per domain)
+4. **No Server-Side Logic**: Custom server-side processing of consent isn't possible
+
+## When to Use Offline Mode
+
+Consider using offline mode when:
+
+- You're building a prototype or MVP
+- Your site doesn't have a backend
+- You want the simplest possible implementation
+- Cross-device synchronization isn't a requirement
+- You have limited compliance needs
+
+For more complex applications or those with stricter compliance requirements, consider [Hosted c15t](/docs/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) instead.

+
+## Decision Guide
+
+<Callout>
+Use this decision tree to determine which storage option best fits your needs.
+</Callout>
+
+1. **Do you need consent data to persist across devices?**
+   - No → Consider **Offline Mode**
+   - Yes → Continue to question 2
+
+2. **Do you need complete control over your consent data?**
+   - No → Use **Hosted c15t** (consent.io)
+   - Yes → Continue to question 3
+
+3. **Do you have an existing consent management system?**
+   - No → Use **Self-Hosting**
+   - Yes → Consider **Custom Client**
+
+## Creating a Client
+
+The main factory function `configureConsentManager` creates the appropriate client implementation based on the provided options:
+
+```tsx
+import { ConsentManagerProvider, configureConsentManager } from '@c15t/react';
+
+// Create a client instance
+const options = {
+  mode: 'c15t', // 'c15t', 'offline', or 'custom'
+  backendURL: '/api/c15t',
+  // Other options based on the mode...
+};
+
+// Use in a React component
+function App() {
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
+      {/* Your app content */}
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+```
+
+## Global Callback Events
+
+All client modes support the following callback events:
+
+```tsx
+const callbacks = {
+  // Called when any request fails
+  onError: (response, path) => {
+    console.error(`Request to ${path} failed:`, response.error);
+  },
+  
+  // Called after successfully fetching consent banner information
+  onConsentBannerFetched: (response) => {
+    console.log('Banner info fetched:', response.data);
+  },
+  
+  // Called after successfully setting consent preferences
+  onConsentSet: (response) => {
+    console.log('Consent set successfully:', response.data);
+  },
+  
+  // Called after successfully verifying consent
+  onConsentVerified: (response) => {
+    console.log('Consent verified:', response.data);
+  }
+};
+```
+
+## When to Use Each Mode
+
+<Callout>
+  Choosing the right mode depends on your specific requirements and constraints.
+</Callout>
+
+- **c15t Mode**: For production applications with a real c15t backend
+- **Offline Mode**: For production applications with your own backend systems, or when you want to eliminate external service dependencies
+- **Custom Mode**: When you need to integrate with an existing consent system but still want to implement custom HTTP request handling
+
+## What's Next
+
+Choose the storage approach that best fits your needs:
+
+- [Hosted c15t](/docs/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) - Use consent.io for a managed solution
+- [Self-Hosting](/docs/storing-consent/self-hosting) - Run your own c15t instance
+- [Offline Mode](/docs/storing-consent/offline-mode) - Store consent in the browser
+- [Custom Client](/docs/storing-consent/custom-client) - Implement your own storage logic

+
+This guide shows you how to set up a self-hosted c15t instance using Next.js API routes, giving you complete control over your consent management system.
+
+<Callout type="info">
+Looking for an easier way? [consent.io](https://consent.io) offers a fully managed c15t backend with minimal setup. See the [Hosted c15t](/docs/storing-consent/hosted-c15t) page for details.
+</Callout>
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+- A working Next.js application
+- Basic understanding of Next.js API routes
+
+<Steps>
+
+<Step>
+### Install `@c15t/backend` Package
+ 
+```package-install
+@c15t/backend
+```
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Create Next.js API Handler
+
+<Callout type="tip">
+Separating your configuration from the API route handler makes it easier to manage and update your c15t instance.
+</Callout>
+
+First, create a separate file for your c15t instance configuration:
+
+<Tabs items={['Memory', 'Kysely', 'Prisma', 'Drizzle']}>
+<Tab value="Memory">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { memoryAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/memory-adapter';
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Next.js Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: memoryAdapter({}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+This example uses the Memory Adapter for simple in-memory storage that's perfect for development and testing. Data is stored in RAM and doesn't persist when the server restarts.
+</Tab>
+
+<Tab value="Kysely">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { kyselyAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/kysely-adapter';
+import { PostgresDialect } from 'kysely';
+import pg from 'pg';
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Next.js Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: kyselyAdapter({
+		dialect: new PostgresDialect({
+			pool: new pg.Pool({
+				host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
+				port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432'),
+				database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'c15t',
+				user: process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres',
+				password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '',
+			}),
+		}),
+	}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+
+This configuration uses the Kysely adapter with PostgreSQL. The Kysely adapter provides a type-safe SQL query builder that works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, offering excellent performance with minimal overhead.
+</Tab>
+
+<Tab value="Prisma">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { prismaAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/prisma-adapter';
+import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
+
+const prisma = new PrismaClient();
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Next.js Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: prismaAdapter({
+		client: prisma,
+	}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+
+This setup integrates Prisma ORM to provide a feature-rich database interface with automatic migrations, relationship handling, and excellent TypeScript integration.
+</Tab>
+
+<Tab value="Drizzle">
+```tsx title="c15t.ts"
+import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
+import { drizzleAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/pkgs/db-adapters/adapters/drizzle-adapter';
+import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js';
+import postgres from 'postgres';
+
+const client = postgres(`postgres://${process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres'}:${process.env.DB_PASSWORD || ''}@${process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost'}:${process.env.DB_PORT || '5432'}/${process.env.DB_NAME || 'c15t'}`);
+const db = drizzle(client);
+
+export const instance = c15tInstance({
+	appName: 'Next.js Example App',
+	basePath: '/api/c15t',
+	database: drizzleAdapter({
+		client: db,
+	}),
+	trustedOrigins: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:8787'],
+});
+```
+
+This example uses the lightweight Drizzle ORM that focuses on performance and type safety with minimal abstractions. It's ideal for projects that need direct SQL access with TypeScript support.
+</Tab>
+</Tabs>
+
+Then, create a catch-all API route that imports and uses this instance:
+
+```tsx title="app/api/c15t/[...all]/route.ts"
+import { toNextHandler } from '@c15t/backend/integrations/next';
+import { instance } from '../c15t';
+
+export const { GET, POST, OPTIONS } = toNextHandler(instance);
+```
+
+This approach separates your instance configuration from the route handler, making it easier for CLI tools and migration utilities to locate and work with your c15t instance.
+</Step>
+
+<Step>
+### Configure Your App to Use the API Route
+
+Update your ConsentManagerOptions to point to your new API route:
+
+```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
+const options: ConsentManagerOptions = {
+	mode: 'c15t',
+	backendURL: '/api/c15t',
+};
+```
+
+This tells the ConsentManagerProvider to use your self-hosted instance instead of an external one.
+</Step>
+
+</Steps>
+
+## Database Options
+
+<Callout type="warning">
+For production use, the Memory Adapter is not recommended as data is lost when the server restarts.
+</Callout>
+
+For production use, you should consider using a persistent database. c15t supports several database adapters:

+title: Styling with CSS Classes
+description: Learn how to customize @c15t/react components using CSS class names and class-based styling.
+---
+
+CSS classes provide a powerful and flexible way to style @c15t/react components. This approach works well with any CSS methodology, including custom CSS, utility classes, or CSS modules.
+
+## Basic Class-Based Styling
+
+The simplest way to style a component is by providing class names directly to theme keys:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'my-banner-container',
+    'banner.header.title': 'banner-title',
+    'banner.header.description': 'banner-description',
+    'banner.footer': 'banner-footer'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+This approach allows you to:
+- Use your own custom CSS classes
+- Apply multiple classes to the same element
+- Create reusable styling patterns
+
+## Object Syntax for Classes
+
+You can also use the object syntax with the `className` property:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      className: 'my-banner-container'
+    },
+    'banner.header.title': {
+      className: 'banner-title'
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+This syntax is especially useful when you need to combine class names with inline styles:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      className: 'my-banner-container',
+      style: {
+        borderColor: dynamicBorderColor
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Combining Class Names
+
+You can provide multiple class names as a space-separated string:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'container mx-auto p-4 rounded-lg'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Using CSS Modules
+
+CSS Modules work perfectly with our theming system:
+
+```tsx
+import styles from './Banner.module.css';
+
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': styles.container,
+    'banner.header.title': styles.title,
+    'banner.header.description': styles.description
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Dynamic Class Names
+
+You can use conditional logic to apply classes dynamically:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': `
+      container 
+      ${isDarkMode ? 'bg-gray-900 text-white' : 'bg-white text-gray-900'}
+    `,
+    'banner.footer': `
+      mt-4 
+      ${isCompact ? 'flex-col gap-2' : 'flex-row gap-4'}
+    `
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Creating Reusable Themes with Class Names
+
+You can create reusable themes by defining class name configurations:
+
+```tsx
+const lightTheme = {
+  'banner.root': 'bg-white text-gray-900 shadow-lg',
+  'banner.header.title': 'text-xl font-bold',
+  'banner.header.description': 'text-gray-600 mt-2',
+  'banner.footer': 'mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2'
+};
+
+const darkTheme = {
+  'banner.root': 'bg-gray-900 text-white shadow-lg border border-gray-800',
+  'banner.header.title': 'text-xl font-bold text-white',
+  'banner.header.description': 'text-gray-300 mt-2',
+  'banner.footer': 'mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2'
+};
+
+// Use the appropriate theme
+<CookieBanner theme={isDarkMode ? darkTheme : lightTheme} />
+```
+
+## Best Practices for Class-Based Styling
+
+1. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
+   - Use a consistent naming methodology (BEM, SMACSS, etc.)
+   - Keep class names descriptive and purpose-driven
+
+2. **Avoid Collisions**
+   - Use namespacing or CSS Modules to prevent class name collisions
+   - Consider component-specific prefixes for custom classes
+
+3. **Separation of Concerns**
+   - Use classes for styling and not for functionality
+   - Keep component structure and styling separate
+
+4. **Performance**
+   - Minimize the number of classes applied to an element
+   - Use CSS custom properties for values that change frequently

+title: Color Scheme (Light/Dark Mode)
+description: Learn how to manage light, dark, and system color schemes in your application using c15t's color scheme utilities.
+---
+
+## Overview
+
+@c15t/react provides built-in support for managing color schemes for your components, allowing you to implement light mode, dark mode, or system-based preferences with minimal configuration.
+
+## Usage
+
+You can control the color scheme through two main approaches:
+
+1. Setting the `colorScheme` prop in `ConsentManagerOptions`
+2. Using the `useColorScheme` hook directly
+
+### Available Options
+
+The color scheme can be set to one of the following values:
+
+- `'light'`: Forces light mode
+- `'dark'`: Forces dark mode
+- `'system'`: Automatically matches the system preference
+- `null`: Falls back to default behavior (respects `.dark` class on root element)
+
+By default, if this prop is not set, it will default to `null`.
+
+### Provider Configuration
+
+You can also configure the color scheme through the `ConsentManagerProvider`:
+
+```tsx
+import { ConsentManagerProvider } from '@c15t/react';
+
+function App({ children }) {
+  return (
+    <ConsentManagerProvider
+      options={{
+        react: {
+          // Components will only be light mode
+          colorScheme: 'light'
+        }
+      }}
+    >
+      {children}
+    </ConsentManagerProvider>
+  );
+}
+```
+
+### Using the Hook
+
+The `useColorScheme` hook provides a simple way to manage color scheme preferences:
+
+```tsx
+import { useColorScheme } from '@c15t/react';
+
+function App() {
+  useColorScheme('system'); // Options: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' | null
+  return <div>Your content</div>;
+}
+```
+
+## CSS Classes
+
+The color scheme system manages two CSS classes:
+
+- `.dark`: The default class for dark mode detection
+- `.c15t-dark`: An internal class used by c15t components
+
+When using the system color scheme:
+- The `.c15t-dark` class is automatically added/removed based on system preferences
+- Components will respond to changes in system color scheme preferences
+- The change is immediate and doesn't require a page reload

+title: Styling with CSS Variables
+description: Learn how to use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) to create flexible and dynamic themes for @c15t/react components.
+---
+import CSSVariablesCookieBannerExample from '~/examples/react/css-variables/index';
+
+
+
+CSS Variables (also known as CSS Custom Properties) provide a powerful way to create dynamic, maintainable themes for @c15t/react components. This approach is particularly useful for dark mode, theming, and responsive design.
+
+## Basic Usage
+
+Each @c15t/react component has a set of predefined CSS variables that you can override:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-background-color': 'white',
+        '--banner-text-color': '#333',
+        '--banner-border-radius': '0.5rem',
+        '--banner-box-shadow': '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+This approach allows you to:
+- Apply consistent theming across components
+- Create dynamic themes that respond to user preferences
+- Implement dark mode with minimal code duplication
+
+## Example
+
+Here's a live example of CSS variables in action:
+
+<CSSVariablesCookieBannerExample />
+
+## Available CSS Variables
+
+Each component in @c15t/react has its own set of CSS variables. Common patterns include:
+
+- `--{component}-background-color`: Background color of the component
+- `--{component}-text-color`: Text color of the component
+- `--{component}-border-radius`: Border radius of the component
+- `--{component}-border-color`: Border color of the component
+- `--{component}-padding`: Padding of the component
+
+Check each component's reference documentation for a complete list of available CSS variables.
+
+## Implementing Dark Mode
+
+CSS Variables are particularly effective for implementing dark mode:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-background-color': isDarkMode ? '#1f2937' : 'white',
+        '--banner-text-color': isDarkMode ? 'white' : '#333',
+        '--banner-border-color': isDarkMode ? '#374151' : '#e5e7eb',
+        '--banner-button-background': isDarkMode ? '#4b5563' : '#f3f4f6'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Nested CSS Variables
+
+You can target nested elements with their specific CSS variables:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-background-color': 'white',
+        '--banner-border-radius': '0.5rem'
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.header.title': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-title-font-size': '1.25rem',
+        '--banner-title-font-weight': '600'
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.footer.accept-button': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-button-background': 'blue',
+        '--banner-button-text-color': 'white'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Responsive Design with CSS Variables
+
+CSS Variables work well with media queries for responsive design:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-padding': '1rem',
+        '--banner-font-size': '0.875rem',
+        '@media (min-width: 768px)': {
+          '--banner-padding': '1.5rem',
+          '--banner-font-size': '1rem'
+        },
+        '@media (min-width: 1024px)': {
+          '--banner-padding': '2rem',
+          '--banner-font-size': '1.125rem'
+        }
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Creating a Theme System with CSS Variables
+
+You can create a comprehensive theme system using CSS variables:
+
+```tsx
+// Theme variables for light and dark modes
+const themes = {
+  light: {
+    '--color-background': 'white',
+    '--color-text': '#333',
+    '--color-primary': '#3b82f6',
+    '--color-secondary': '#6b7280',
+    '--color-border': '#e5e7eb',
+    '--shadow-sm': '0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)',
+    '--shadow-md': '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
+  },
+  dark: {
+    '--color-background': '#1f2937',
+    '--color-text': 'white',
+    '--color-primary': '#60a5fa',
+    '--color-secondary': '#9ca3af',
+    '--color-border': '#374151',
+    '--shadow-sm': '0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)',
+    '--shadow-md': '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)'
+  }
+};
+
+// Apply the current theme to components
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        '--banner-background-color': 'var(--color-background)',
+        '--banner-text-color': 'var(--color-text)',
+        '--banner-border-color': 'var(--color-border)',
+        '--banner-box-shadow': 'var(--shadow-md)'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Best Practices for CSS Variables
+
+1. **Naming Convention**
+   - Use a consistent naming pattern: `--component-property-state`
+   - Use kebab-case for variable names
+
+2. **Fallback Values**
+   - Always provide fallback values for critical styling
+   - Use the `var()` function's second parameter for fallbacks
+
+3. **Scoping**
+   - Scope variables appropriately to avoid leakage
+   - Consider organizing variables by component or feature
+
+4. **Performance**
+   - Minimize the number of CSS variable changes during runtime
+   - Batch variable updates when possible

+title: General Styling
+description: Learn the core concepts of the @c15t/react theming system and how it enables flexible component styling.
+---
+
+## Understanding the Theming System
+
+Think of our theming system as a set of style instructions that cascade through your components, similar to CSS but with more structure and type safety. Each component has specific customizable areas, called theme keys, that you can target for styling.
+
+The theming system provides a structured way to customize the appearance of components while maintaining their functionality and accessibility. It allows you to:
+
+- Target specific elements within a component
+- Apply consistent styling across your application
+- Ensure type safety and prevent styling errors
+
+## Theme Key Structure
+
+Every theme key in our system follows a predictable pattern that makes it easy to target specific elements within a component:
+
+```
+'componentName.elementPath.subElement'
+```
+
+1. **Component Name**: The base name of the component (e.g., `banner`, `widget`, `dialog`)
+2. **Element Path**: The path to the element within the component (e.g., `header.title`, `footer.accept-button`)
+3. **State Variations**: Optional state indicators (e.g., `switch.thumb.checked`, `button.hover`)
+
+### Component Hierarchies
+
+Components are structured in a hierarchical manner, which is reflected in their theme keys:
+
+```tsx
+// Example of nested component styling
+const theme = {
+  'widget.root': 'container mx-auto',
+  'widget.accordion': 'space-y-2',
+  'widget.accordion.item': 'border rounded-sm',
+  'widget.accordion.trigger': 'p-4 hover:bg-gray-50',
+  'widget.accordion.trigger-inner': '',
+  'widget.accordion.content': 'p-4 bg-gray-50'
+}
+```
+
+Each level in the hierarchy can be styled independently, giving you fine-grained control over the appearance.
+
+### Visualizing the Hierarchy
+
+Here's a simplified visualization of a typical accordion component:
+
+```
+widget.root
+└── widget.accordion
+    └── widget.accordion.item
+        ├── widget.accordion.trigger
+        │   └── widget.accordion.trigger-inner
+        └── widget.accordion.content
+```
+
+## Using Theme Context
+
+For consistent styling across your application, you can use the `ThemeProvider` component to apply a global theme:
+
+```tsx
+import { ThemeProvider } from '@c15t/react'
+
+const globalTheme = {
+  'banner.root': 'bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+  'dialog.root': 'bg-white rounded-lg shadow-xl',
+  'widget.root': 'bg-gray-50 rounded border'
+}
+
+function App() {
+  return (
+    <ThemeProvider theme={globalTheme}>
+      <YourApp />
+    </ThemeProvider>
+  )
+}
+```
+
+### Theme Inheritance
+
+Components can still define their own themes, which will merge with and override the global theme:
+
+```tsx
+<ThemeProvider theme={globalTheme}>
+  {/* Uses the global theme */}
+  <CookieBanner />
+  
+  {/* Overrides parts of the global theme */}
+  <CookieBanner 
+    theme={{
+      'banner.root': 'bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg'
+    }}
+  />
+</ThemeProvider>
+```
+
+## Type-Safe Styling
+
+Our theming system includes TypeScript support to help prevent errors:
+
+```tsx
+import type { CookieBannerTheme } from '@c15t/react'
+
+// TypeScript will catch invalid theme keys
+const theme: CookieBannerTheme = {
+  'banner.root': 'bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+  'banner.invalid': 'TypeScript error!' // Error: invalid key
+}
+```
+
+## Disabling Default Styles
+
+Sometimes you might want to start from scratch. Use the `noStyle` prop to remove all default styling:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner noStyle theme={yourCustomTheme} />
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+1. **Maintain Accessibility**
+   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
+   - Keep interactive elements visually distinct
+   - Test your styles with screen readers
+
+2. **Consider Responsive Design**
+   - Start with mobile-first styles
+   - Use flexible units (rem, em) over fixed pixels
+   - Test across different screen sizes
+
+3. **Performance**
+   - Group related styles together
+   - Avoid unnecessary style overrides
+   - Use CSS classes over inline styles when possible
+
+4. **Maintainability**
+   - Keep theme configurations organized
+   - Document custom styles
+   - Use consistent naming conventions

+title: Styling with Inline Styles
+description: Learn how to use inline style objects to customize @c15t/react components for dynamic and programmatic styling.
+---
+import CSSCookieBannerExample from '~/examples/react/css/index';
+
+Inline styles provide a direct way to style @c15t/react components using JavaScript objects. This approach is particularly useful for dynamic styles that need to be calculated at runtime or when you need to apply styles programmatically.
+
+## Basic Usage
+
+You can apply inline styles to components using the style object:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        backgroundColor: 'white',
+        padding: '1rem',
+        borderRadius: '0.5rem',
+        boxShadow: '0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.header.title': {
+      style: {
+        fontSize: '1.25rem',
+        fontWeight: 600,
+        color: '#333'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+This approach allows you to:
+- Apply styles directly without external CSS
+- Calculate style values dynamically at runtime
+- Maintain all styling within your JavaScript code
+
+## Example
+
+Here's a live example of inline styles in action:
+
+<CSSCookieBannerExample />
+
+## Style Property Names
+
+When using inline styles, CSS property names are written in camelCase rather than kebab-case:
+
+| CSS Property | JavaScript Style Property |
+|------------|------------------------|
+| `background-color` | `backgroundColor` |
+| `font-size` | `fontSize` |
+| `border-radius` | `borderRadius` |
+| `padding-top` | `paddingTop` |
+
+## Dynamic Styling
+
+Inline styles excel at dynamic styling based on component state or props:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        backgroundColor: isImportant ? '#fff8e6' : 'white',
+        borderColor: isPending ? '#d97706' : '#e5e7eb',
+        borderWidth: hasError ? '2px' : '1px',
+        opacity: isDisabled ? 0.7 : 1
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Combining with Other Styling Methods
+
+You can combine inline styles with class names for maximum flexibility:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      className: 'banner-container',
+      style: {
+        backgroundColor: theme === 'light' ? 'white' : '#1f2937'
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.header.title': {
+      className: 'banner-title',
+      style: {
+        color: theme === 'light' ? '#111827' : 'white'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Nested Styles
+
+You can target nested elements with their own style objects:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      style: {
+        padding: '1.5rem',
+        backgroundColor: 'white'
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.header': {
+      style: {
+        marginBottom: '1rem'
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.header.title': {
+      style: {
+        fontSize: '1.25rem',
+        fontWeight: 600
+      }
+    },
+    'banner.footer.accept-button': {
+      style: {
+        backgroundColor: 'blue',
+        color: 'white',
+        padding: '0.5rem 1rem',
+        borderRadius: '0.25rem'
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Units and Values
+
+When specifying dimensions in inline styles:
+
+- Pixel values can be provided as numbers: `width: 100` (becomes `width: 100px`)
+- Other units must be strings: `fontSize: '1.25rem'`, `width: '50%'`
+- Unitless values like `fontWeight` and `opacity` are provided as numbers
+
+## Best Practices for Inline Styles
+
+1. **Performance Considerations**
+   - Prefer CSS classes for static styles
+   - Use inline styles for truly dynamic values
+
+2. **Readability and Maintenance**
+   - Group related styles together
+   - Use descriptive variable names for complex style calculations
+
+3. **Browser Compatibility**
+   - Be aware that some CSS features like media queries can't be used directly in inline styles
+   - Consider CSS Variables or class-based styling for more complex responsive designs
+
+4. **Avoid Overuse**
+   - Inline styles don't benefit from CSS cascading and inheritance
+   - Use sparingly for specific dynamic styling needs

+title: Styling with Tailwind CSS
+description: Learn how to use Tailwind CSS utility classes with @c15t/react components for rapid and consistent styling.
+---
+import TailwindCookieBannerExample from '~/examples/react/tailwind/index';
+
+Tailwind CSS is perfectly suited for styling @c15t/react components. Our theming system allows you to apply Tailwind's utility classes directly to components, providing a powerful and efficient styling workflow.
+
+## Basic Usage
+
+You can apply Tailwind utility classes directly to component theme keys:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+    'banner.header.title': 'text-xl font-bold text-gray-900',
+    'banner.header.description': 'text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2',
+    'banner.footer': 'mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+This approach allows you to:
+- Style components without writing custom CSS
+- Maintain a consistent design system
+- Make quick adjustments with immediate visual feedback
+
+## Example
+
+Here's a live example of Tailwind CSS styling:
+
+<TailwindCookieBannerExample />
+
+## Responsive Design
+
+Tailwind's responsive utilities work seamlessly with our theming system:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8 w-full md:w-auto',
+    'banner.header.title': 'text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl',
+    'banner.header.description': 'text-sm md:text-base',
+    'banner.footer': 'flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-2'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Dark Mode
+
+If you've configured Tailwind's dark mode, you can use dark variants:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+    'banner.header.title': 'text-gray-900 dark:text-white font-bold',
+    'banner.header.description': 'text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mt-2'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Creating Reusable Themes
+
+You can define reusable Tailwind-based themes for consistent styling:
+
+```tsx
+const bannerTheme = {
+  'banner.root': 'bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+  'banner.header.title': 'text-xl font-bold text-gray-900',
+  'banner.header.description': 'text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2',
+  'banner.footer': 'mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2',
+  'banner.footer.accept-button': 'btn btn-primary',
+  'banner.footer.reject-button': 'btn btn-secondary'
+};
+
+<CookieBanner theme={bannerTheme} />
+```
+
+## Combining with Custom CSS
+
+You can combine Tailwind utilities with custom CSS when needed:
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': {
+      className: 'bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+      style: {
+        borderColor: dynamicBorderColor
+      }
+    }
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Common UI Patterns with Tailwind
+
+### Creating a Modern Card-Like Component
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 max-w-lg mx-auto',
+    'banner.header.title': 'text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900',
+    'banner.header.description': 'text-gray-500 mt-2',
+    'banner.footer': 'mt-6 flex justify-end space-x-4'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+### Creating a Minimalist Style
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'border border-gray-200 p-4',
+    'banner.header.title': 'text-gray-900 font-medium',
+    'banner.header.description': 'text-gray-500 text-sm',
+    'banner.footer': 'mt-4 flex justify-end gap-2'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+### Creating a Colorful, Bold Style
+
+```tsx
+<CookieBanner 
+  theme={{
+    'banner.root': 'bg-indigo-600 text-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg',
+    'banner.header.title': 'text-2xl font-bold',
+    'banner.header.description': 'text-indigo-100 mt-2',
+    'banner.footer': 'mt-6 flex justify-end gap-4'
+  }}
+/>
+```
+
+## Best Practices with Tailwind
+
+1. **Keep It Consistent**
+   - Create a design system with consistent spacing, colors, and typography
+   - Use Tailwind's configuration to define your design tokens
+
+2. **Responsive Design**
+   - Start with mobile styling, then add responsive modifiers
+   - Test your components at different viewport sizes
+
+3. **Reuse Patterns**
+   - Extract common utility combinations into reusable themes
+   - Consider using Tailwind's `@apply` in CSS for frequently used patterns
+
+4. **Accessibility**
+   - Ensure sufficient color contrast (use Tailwind's accessibility tools)
+   - Don't rely solely on color to convey information
+
+5. **Performance**
+   - Use Tailwind's JIT mode to keep CSS bundle size small
+   - Be mindful of utility combination complexity
