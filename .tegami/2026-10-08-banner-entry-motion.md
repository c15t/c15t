### Show the consent banner at once, and fade it in only when it arrives late

The banner and the IAB banner no longer slide or scale in on a spring curve.
A banner that shows with the page is part of the first paint, where the
overshoot read as layout shift, so it now appears on its first frame. The
backdrop of a blocking banner appears with it.

A banner that arrives more than 100ms after the page first painted, such as
after a slow script or a client-side init, fades in instead of popping into a
page someone is already reading. It fades over `--c15t-duration-normal` on
`--c15t-easing-out` and never moves. Its root and backdrop carry
`data-entry="late"`, and `--consent-banner-entry-duration` and
`--consent-banner-entry-timing` (`--iab-consent-banner-entry-*` for the IAB
banner) set the fade. A banner rendered on the server always shows at once.
`@c15t/ui/utils/late-entry` exports the check as `isLateEntry`.

Hiding still fades the banner out where it did before, now without the slide
or scale, and on an ease-in curve so it speeds up as it leaves.
`disableAnimation` turns both fades off.

Add the `--c15t-easing-in` theme token, set with `motion.easingIn`. It defaults
to `cubic-bezier(0.55, 0.055, 0.675, 0.19)` and sets the banner's exit curve.
