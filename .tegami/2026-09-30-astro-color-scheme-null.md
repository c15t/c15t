### Accept `colorScheme: null` in Astro

The integration's `colorScheme` accepts `null` with the same meaning as `'none'`: c15t neither sets nor clears `c15t-dark` on `<html>`. `null` is the value the React, Vue and Svelte providers use for this, so a shared config works in all of them. The default stays `'system'`.
