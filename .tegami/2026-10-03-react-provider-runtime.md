### React provider on the shared runtime

`@c15t/react`'s `ConsentProvider` now renders the runtime from
`createConsentProviderRuntime`, the same one the Svelte provider uses, instead
of its own copy. Its props, hooks and the `runtime` prop are unchanged.
`ConsentRoot` in `@c15t/nextjs` and `@c15t/tanstack-start` picks this up.

**Breaking.** `persistence` and `storageConfig` are read once, when the
provider mounts. A new storage key used to move the stored choice to the new
key; now the choice stays where it was, data clearing keeps protecting that
key, and a warning is logged outside production. The same applies to every
provider runtime, including Svelte's. Migration: remount the provider to move
storage.

Behaviour that changes:

- A `prefetch` that is still marked `initialPolicyPending` is no longer
  adopted as the answer: the provider sends `/init`.
- Adopting a server-resolved `prefetch` raises `init:applied`, as an `/init`
  response does.
- A streamed `prefetch` that carries an experiment but arrives after mount
  keeps `experiment` in the `/init` request the provider falls back to.
- A provider rendered under a `consentSource` raises `init:applied` once the
  source is connected.

`persistence.now` is passed through to persistence; the runtime used to drop it.
