### Remove dialog scheduling delays and preserve IAB actions

Remove first-open scheduling delays from React's aggregate dialog, widget, and compound components while preserving server rendering and hydration. Keep children mounted when an external runtime provides IAB context, so loading the bridge cannot reset local drafts.

Remove the extra Suspense delay from Astro's React IAB dialog island.

Queue external-runtime IAB actions until the runtime publishes its handle, and reject pending saves with AbortError when the borrowing provider unmounts. Correct the React and Next.js peer dependency ranges to require React and React DOM 18 or newer, matching the APIs already used by v3. Upgrade both React packages before using v3 on an older installation.
