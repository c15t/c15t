### `ConsentGate` mounts a granted embed after hydration

**Breaking.** With the App Router's awaited `resolveConsent` layout, a returning visitor
who had allowed the category downloaded a `ConsentGate` iframe twice. The
page streams inside a `Suspense` boundary, and React moves that HTML into
place after the browser has parsed it. The browser starts loading the
iframe during parsing and loads it again after the move.

`ConsentGate` no longer puts granted children in the server HTML. A denied
category still gets the placeholder there. A granted category gets the empty
wrapper, and its children mount once hydration completes, so the iframe loads
once in every layout. Client-side renders mount the children at once, as
before.

#### Migration

- Server HTML for a granted `ConsentGate` no longer contains its children.
  Tests or crawlers that read the embed from the server response need to wait
  for hydration.
- Size the wrapper with `className` or `style` so the page keeps the embed's
  space while it mounts.
