### Resolve unknown locations on static pages with the manifest's own policy

`createStaticConsentResolver` from `@c15t/tanstack-start/static` now starts a visitor with no known location on the manifest's unknown-location policy (its `fallback` pack, else its `default` pack), as `@c15t/nextjs/static` already did and as server rendering does when location headers are missing. It previously picked the strictest pack in the manifest and applied it to everyone, including packs scoped to other countries. A manifest with no fallback or default pack now resolves to a failed `insufficient-inputs` result, and the client applies its safe fallback.

The static resolver now lives in `@c15t/core/static` (also available as `c15t/static`), and both framework `static` entries re-export it. `resolveStrictestDefaultInit` is renamed to `resolveUnknownLocationInit`. The old name still works in `@c15t/nextjs/static` and `@c15t/tanstack-start/static` and is marked deprecated.
