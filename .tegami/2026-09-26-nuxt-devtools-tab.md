### Inspect consent from a c15t tab in Nuxt DevTools

In development, the Nuxt module adds a c15t tab to Nuxt DevTools. The tab shows the DevTools panels for the app's consent kernel, including events and consent actions, and follows the DevTools light or dark theme. Production builds don't register the tab. Set `devtools: false` in the module options to turn it off.

`c15t/vue/devtools` and `@c15t/vue/devtools` now export `ConsentDevToolsPanel`, which fills its parent element instead of floating over the page. `createDevTools` accepts `embedded: true` for the same layout, and can render into a same-origin iframe while it inspects the page that owns the kernel.

Embedded panels, including the TanStack Devtools plugin from `c15t/react/devtools`, no longer show their own c15t header, because the host already names the panel.
