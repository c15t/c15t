### One manifest cache for every server adapter

Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro and TanStack Start now read the backend manifest through one function, `fetchCachedManifest` from `@c15t/core/server`, and share one in-process cache of up to 128 entries. Before, SvelteKit and Astro kept a separate 64-entry cache and Next.js a third one, and each took different options.

The cache key is now the same for every caller. Query parameters are sorted by name and the URL fragment is dropped, so `?b=2&a=1` and `?a=1&b=2` read one entry and reach the backend as one request. That request keeps the first caller's URL and query as written, so a signed `manifestURL` still verifies. Request headers that equal the ones the cache sends anyway (`accept: application/json` and the c15t protocol headers) no longer split the cache. The `init` option passes a framework fetch hint such as Next.js `{ next: { revalidate } }` and is not part of the key.

**Breaking.**

- `@c15t/core/libs/manifest-cache` and `c15t/libs/manifest-cache` are removed. Import `fetchCachedManifest` and `clearManifestCache` from `@c15t/core/server` (`c15t/server`) and pass `sourceURL` instead of `url`. The `CachedManifest` type is now `CachedManifestResponse`.
- `fetchCachedManifest` from `@c15t/core/server` and `@c15t/astro/api` takes `sourceURL` instead of `config` (build it with `resolveManifestSourceURL({ backendURL, manifestURL })` from `@c15t/core/server`), and reads the shared cache. The `ManifestSourceConfig` type is removed; use `ManifestSourceOptions`.
- `@c15t/vue/runtime/server/manifest-mode` and `c15t/vue/runtime/server/manifest-mode` are removed. Import the manifest cache and its helpers from `@c15t/core/server` instead, and `resolveManifestInit` and `getResolverInputsFromHeaders` from `@c15t/core/transports/manifest-cache`; `clearManifestRouteCache()` is `clearManifestCache()`.
