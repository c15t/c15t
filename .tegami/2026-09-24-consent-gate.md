### Rename `Frame` to `ConsentGate`

`Frame` is now `ConsentGate` in React, Next.js, TanStack Start and Svelte, and Vue's `ConsentFrame` is now `ConsentGate`. The compound parts follow: `ConsentGate.Root`, `ConsentGate.Title` and `ConsentGate.Button`, with `ConsentGateProps` and `ConsentGateCompoundComponent` types. New subpaths are `c15t/react/consent-gate`, `c15t/react/components/consent-gate` and `@c15t/vue/runtime/components/consent-gate.vue`, and Nuxt auto-registers `<ConsentGate>`.

The old names, subpaths and Nuxt component remain as deprecated aliases for the same component. Props, behavior, `frame.*` translation keys, `--frame-*` CSS custom properties and `data-testid="frame-placeholder"` are unchanged.
