### One tenant setting, refused when it is unsafe, and recovery for visitors whose subject ID another tenant holds

A self-hosted backend now names its tenant in one place: the instance's `tenantId`. `manifest.tenantId` is removed from the backend configuration. It never scoped a database query, but it did scope policy snapshot tokens when the instance had no `tenantId`, so a config that set only that one issued tokens for a tenant while writing every consent with a null tenant. Built manifests no longer carry it. `ConsentManifest.tenantId` stays on the wire type for other manifest producers.

`c15tInstance` and `createApp` check the tenant when the instance is built. They throw when `tenantId` is empty, padded with whitespace or not a string (a `null` from a JavaScript config used to scope every query to `tenantId = NULL`, which matches nothing), and when the config still sets `manifest.tenantId`, rather than ignoring it. The new `requireTenantId: true` option makes a missing `tenantId` throw too. Set it on every instance that shares a database with other tenants. Without it, an instance whose tenant lookup returned `undefined` starts in the single-tenant scope and writes consents with a null tenant, which the tenant that owns them never reads.

Subject IDs are chosen by the browser and are unique across the whole database. A save naming a subject ID that another tenant holds was answered `400 CONFLICT`, on every save, with no way for the visitor to recover. It is now `409 SUBJECT_CONFLICT`. `@c15t/core` responds by giving the visitor a new subject ID, moving any queued saves to it, and sending the choice once more. Every open tab moves to the same new ID. A consent recorded again with different receipts, purposes or vendor grants is now `409 CONFLICT` instead of `400`. The hosted and manifest transports treat both as permanent refusals, so the kernel no longer replays them from its queue.

#### Migration

- Remove `tenantId` from the backend's `manifest` block and set it on the instance. If the instance already sets the same value, delete the manifest one. If it set only `manifest.tenantId`, the instance has been writing rows with a null tenant: setting `tenantId` scopes it to that tenant, and those rows stop appearing in its reads.
- Code that matched `400` with `cause.code: 'CONFLICT'` from `POST /subjects` should expect `409`, and `SUBJECT_CONFLICT` for a subject ID held by another tenant. `PUT /legal-documents` conflicts are still `400 CONFLICT`.
- A manifest built from a config that set `tenantId` gets a new `revision`, so cached manifests refresh once.
