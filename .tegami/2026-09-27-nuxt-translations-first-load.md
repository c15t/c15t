### Stop Nuxt pages from downloading every locale on first load

In a Nuxt 4 build, every page downloaded the all-locale translations chunk (about 57 KB gzip, 206 KB raw) in its first load, in server manifest mode, hosted mode and client manifest mode alike. Only client manifest mode uses it. The Vue runtime imported the manifest resolver and the translations with two separate `import()` calls, and Vite 8 put a helper that the app entry needs into the translations chunk, so the entry loaded that chunk statically.

The runtime now loads both through one module. Server manifest and hosted mode no longer download the translations. Client manifest mode, which resolves the manifest as the page starts, now bundles the resolver with the entry through a plugin the Nuxt module adds in that mode, so the page still preloads it. Plain Vue apps built with Vite were not affected and load the same code as before.
