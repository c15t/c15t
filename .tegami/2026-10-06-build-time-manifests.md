### Generate consent manifests during application builds

Add opt-in build-time manifest snapshots for Next.js, TanStack Start, Astro,
Nuxt and Vite apps. Build plugins take `backendURL` and fetch its `/manifest`.
Server helpers and consent routes resolve from the snapshot without fetching
an upstream manifest. Geography, language, privacy signals and stored consent
still resolve per visitor.

Snapshots stay fixed until the next build. Use runtime fetching for policy
updates that must apply without a rebuild. A manifest fetch failure or
invalid snapshot fails the build. Consent saves, session reports and IAB
vendor lists still call the backend.

Svelte's framework-free `resolveConsent` also accepts a snapshot. Both Svelte
server helpers take a background-work callback to keep session reports alive
on serverless hosts without `waitUntil`.

Next.js runtime manifest requests use the App Router Data Cache with a
300-second revalidation. `manifestRevalidateSeconds: false` skips that cache
instead of caching indefinitely.
