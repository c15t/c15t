### Keep consent changes flowing when a listener throws or updates consent

A snapshot subscriber or event listener that throws no longer stops the
listeners after it, and no longer rejects the `commands.save()` that caused the
change. Before, a throwing subscriber kept later subscribers and persistence
from seeing a denial and suppressed `choice:recorded`, even though the
permission had already changed in memory. c15t now passes the error to
`reportError` in a browser page and logs it with `console.error` elsewhere, so a
throwing listener can't end a Bun or Deno server process.

Listeners also receive the snapshot the change produced, and every listener sees
changes in commit order. Before, a subscriber that granted consent again while
being told about a denial made later subscribers see the new grant twice and
miss the denial. Now each of them sees the denial and then the grant. The
`choice:recorded` event of the outer save also carries its own snapshot.
Listeners that keep changing consent in response to each other are stopped
after 100 nested notifications, and the error is reported. Notifications already
queued still arrive, so other listeners end on the current snapshot.
