### One server-side consent resolution for every adapter

`resolveConsent` in Next.js, TanStack Start and SvelteKit, `loadConsent` and `c15tHandle` in SvelteKit, the Astro middleware and the Nuxt plugin now resolve a request's consent state through one function, `resolveRequestConsent` from `@c15t/core/server`. Each adapter keeps its own entry point and reads the request with its framework's API. The copies had drifted; every adapter now follows these rules:

- **What the backend receives.** A hosted `/init` request carries the resolved country, region, language and GPC signal, the `user-agent`, and the experiment arm while the visitor has no stored choice. Over `https` or to a loopback host it also carries the consent cookie (`cookieName` or `storageConfig.storageKey`) and any `forwardHeaders`. It never carries the rest of the cookie jar: Next.js and SvelteKit used to send every cookie the site owns. The visitor IP travels as `x-forwarded-for` only with `trustForwardedHeaders`; Next.js and SvelteKit used to copy the client's `x-forwarded-for`. `forwardHeaders` cannot name `cookie` or a `forwarded`/`x-forwarded-*` header. A manifest request carries nothing about the visitor unless you name headers or cookies for it.
- **Own routes.** A server render never fetches the app's own consent routes over the network: a URL on the request's origin under `/api/c15t`, or under the routes an adapter declares (Next.js `config.manifestURL` and `config.initURL`, TanStack Start `routePrefix`, Astro's injected endpoints). It renders without a server decision and, in Next.js, says why in development. SvelteKit and Nuxt reach their own init route in-process through `event.fetch` and Nitro's local fetch, as before.
- **Next.js manifest source.** With `config` and a same-origin `config.manifestURL`, `resolveConsent` reads `${config.backendURL}/manifest` through the same process cache entry the manifest route uses, instead of fetching that route. The Pages Router example `resolveConsent({ backendURL: '/api/c15t', req })` fetched the app's own init route on every render; use `resolveConsent({ config: consentConfig, req })`.
- **GPC.** Every adapter reads `x-c15t-gpc`, then `sec-gpc`, and leaves an absent signal `undefined`. SvelteKit read only `sec-gpc` and turned a missing header into `false`.
- **Budget.** `timeoutMs` means the same everywhere: `false` or `Infinity` waits for the upstream, and a value that is not a finite, non-negative number uses the 500 ms default. Astro and Nuxt turned `NaN` into no budget. `@c15t/svelte/server`'s `resolveConsent` now has the same 500 ms default; it had none.
- **Shared renders.** A prerendered or cached render reads no visitor facts, carries no stored records, clock, GPC signal or experiment arm, and makes no hosted or manifest request; offline mode still resolves. TanStack Start applies it while it prerenders and accepts `shared`. SvelteKit accepts `shared` on `c15tHandle` and `loadConsent`; pass SvelteKit's `building` flag. Astro (`isPrerendered`) and Nuxt (prerender and cache route rules) keep their rules.
- **Vendor list.** The full Global Vendor List is replaced by a reference whenever the browser can fetch it the same way: no custom `fetch`, and no cookie or private header on the request. The app's own init route reads no cookie, so SvelteKit and Nuxt in-process renders send none and keep the reference.

**Breaking.**

- `@c15t/nextjs/server` no longer exports `DEFAULT_FORWARD_HEADERS` (`x-forwarded-for` and `user-agent`), and there is no default list to extend. `resolveConsent` always sends `user-agent`, sends the visitor IP as `x-forwarded-for` only with `trustForwardedHeaders: true`, and adds the request headers you name in its `forwardHeaders` option. `onError` receives an error that names the URL, with the original failure as `cause`.
- `@c15t/astro/api` no longer exports `loadConsentManifest`, `resolveManifestInit`, `resolveSessionReportURL`, `ResolvedInitOutput` or `SessionReportTarget`; the server render uses `resolveRequestConsent`. The server render no longer sends the consent cookie over plain HTTP to a same-origin host that is not loopback.
- `@c15t/vue/runtime/manifest` no longer exports `C15T_TIMEOUT_HEADER`, `DEFAULT_NUXT_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS` or `resolveNuxtTimeoutMs`. Use `CONSENT_ROUTE_TIMEOUT_HEADER` from `@c15t/core/server`. The Nuxt plugin keeps the resolved state in `useState('c15t:consent')` instead of a `useFetch` result under `c15t:init`. On a route rendered only in the browser (`ssr: false`), the plugin no longer holds the app's mount until `/init` answers: the app paints first and the runtime starts init once it mounts. The Nuxt client bundle drops `useFetch` and the vendor-list deferral code from the plugin (about 4.6 KB gzip of initial JavaScript in the benchmark app).
- In `@c15t/svelte/kit`, `C15tHandleOptions` is an interface with `shared`, and `loadConsent`'s `fetch` is used only for a backend on another origin; same-origin URLs always go through `event.fetch`.
