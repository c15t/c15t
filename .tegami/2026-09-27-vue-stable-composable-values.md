### Re-render Vue components only when their consent value changes

`useHasConsent()`, `useConsentInit()` and `useConsentPolicyActions()` returned a new array or object on every kernel update, so a component reading one re-rendered whenever anything changed, including opening the dialog. They now keep their previous value while its contents are unchanged. A component using `useHasConsent()` re-renders when a category is granted or revoked, and one using `useConsentInit()` when translations, location, branding or IAB data change. The stock banner, dialog and preference widget read these values too, and follow the same rule.
