### Keep open tabs in step with stored consent

A choice saved in one tab now reaches the other open tabs on the same origin
without a reload. Before, a tab kept a grant after another tab stored a denial,
and neither `kernel.refresh()` nor `runtime.reinit()` read storage again.

Browser persistence reads stored records again when another tab on the same
origin changes a c15t localStorage key, when the page becomes visible and when
the window regains focus. A tab on another subdomain that shares the consent
cookie gets no `storage` event and catches up on its next focus or visibility
change. Category decisions merge per category, keeping the newer decision for
each, and privacy directives merge as a union. A stored notice or vendor record
replaces the one in memory unless it is older. A record removed from storage is
cleared, so the active policy decides again. Blocked storage or bytes that do
not decode change nothing. Reconnecting does not read storage.

Queued writes follow the same rules. A tab lands its own pending write before it
reads, a choice write stores the per-category merge with what storage holds, a
directive write keeps every stored directive, and the rewrite that adds a
server subject id no longer recreates records another tab cleared.

New API:

- `runtime.reconcileStorage()` and `persistence.reconcile()` read stored
  records on demand and return whether anything changed. React's
  `usePersistence()` handle has `reconcile()` too.
- `persistence: { sync: false }` keeps storage but turns off the automatic
  reads. `dispose()` removes the listeners.
