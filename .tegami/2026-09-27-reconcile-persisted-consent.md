### Keep open tabs in step with stored consent

A choice saved in one tab now reaches the other open tabs on the same origin
without a reload. Before, a tab kept a grant after another tab stored a denial,
and neither `kernel.refresh()` nor `runtime.reinit()` read storage again.

Browser persistence reads stored records again when another tab on the same
origin changes a c15t localStorage key, when the page becomes visible and when
the window regains focus. A tab on another subdomain that shares the consent
cookie gets no `storage` event and catches up on its next focus or visibility
change, and so does every tab when localStorage is unavailable and only the
cookie is stored. Category decisions merge per category, keeping the newer decision for
each, and privacy directives merge as a union. A stored notice or vendor record
replaces the one in memory unless it is older. A record removed from storage is
cleared, so the active policy decides again. Blocked storage or bytes that do
not decode change nothing. Reconnecting does not read storage.

Queued writes follow the same rules. A tab lands its own pending write before it
reads, a choice write stores the per-category merge with what storage holds, a
directive write keeps every stored directive, and the rewrite that adds a
server subject id no longer recreates records another tab cleared. When two
tabs act in the same millisecond, the record stored first wins in both. A
tab that opened before another stored a subject joins the stored subject
unless it identified a different user; a subject id the server resolved is
kept unless a strictly newer stored choice carries another one. Only a
record this tab saw in storage is cleared when it disappears, so a choice
seeded while storage was blocked survives storage becoming readable.

Under an IAB policy, `@c15t/iab` loads the TC string another tab stored once
its choice is reconciled, with its purpose, vendor and special-feature
selections, so `__tcfapi` and the preference controls no longer show the
previous choice. Selections changed in this tab without saving are kept. A
TC string that grants any purpose of a category denied after it was saved
is withdrawn and not restored on the next page load; a partial purpose
selection saved through IAB keeps its TC string. A TC string confirmed before
the reconciled choice's newest decision, such as after a save on a sibling
subdomain that shares the consent cookie, is withdrawn as well, since the TC
string and its receipt belong to one origin. A newer receipt replaces the held
one even when the TC string is identical.

Clearing records now stores the clear epoch, the time of the clear, under
`c15t-epoch` in localStorage and a cookie of the same name, and clearing never
removes it. Every consent record written afterwards records its epoch too.
Decisions confirmed before the epoch are void everywhere: a tab that reconciles
after another tab cleared and saved again drops its pre-clear decisions, a tab
that missed the clear cannot write them back, and browser hydration and server
reads (`readStoredRecordsFromCookieHeader`) ignore them. A decision in the
clearing millisecond counts only from a tab that had seen the clear. Each clear
moves the epoch forward even after the clock went back, and an epoch up to an
hour ahead of the clock is kept. Records from before any clear, including v2
and legacy records, read as epoch 0 and are unaffected; a corrupt epoch also
reads as 0, and a record whose epoch field is corrupt is kept.

The consent cookie stays authoritative, but a denial in its localStorage copy
that is newer than the cookie's decision is now applied on top of it, so a
dropped cookie write no longer keeps an older grant in force. Copies written
under different clear epochs are cut to the later epoch first, and the
subject comes from the later copy. Privacy directives from both copies of the
privacy record apply, a newer local vendor list adds denials without lifting
any (a vendor copy from before the last clear is ignored), and the newer notice
dismissal applies. A newer local
grant is still not applied.

This changes the stored format: after a clear, the consent cookie gains
`&e=<time>` (16 bytes) and the localStorage record an `epoch` field (22 bytes).
Visitors who never cleared store what they did before. Older c15t builds reject
both the cookie and the localStorage record once they carry the epoch and treat
the visitor as undecided, so under an opt-out policy they grant optional
categories by default until a new choice is saved. Deploy the new build to every
page of the site before visitors can clear their records.

When two tabs write at the same moment and one write drops the other tab's
category or directive, the tab that lost it writes it back on its next
reconciliation. Under an IAB policy, a TC string that grants a category a
reconciled denial covers is withdrawn before any `__tcfapi` listener is
notified, and one that predates another tab's newer choice is held back until
this tab reads that tab's receipt, so a revoked vendor is never advertised
again.

New API:

- `runtime.reconcileStorage()` and `persistence.reconcile()` read stored
  records on demand and return whether anything changed. React's
  `usePersistence()` handle has `reconcile()` too.
- `persistence: { sync: false }` keeps storage but turns off the automatic
  reads. `dispose()` removes the listeners.
