### One consent route handler for every server adapter

The `/manifest` and `/init` routes of Next.js, TanStack Start, SvelteKit, Astro and Nuxt now run on one handler, `createConsentRouteHandler` from `@c15t/core/server`. Each adapter keeps its own entry point (route handlers, server routes, `RequestHandler`, `APIRoute`, h3 event handlers) and the same options. The copies had drifted; every adapter now follows these rules:

- The manifest route passes only a `language` query parameter that looks like a language tag to the backend. Other parameters a visitor adds are dropped, so they no longer reach the backend or add manifest cache entries. SvelteKit, Astro and Nuxt used to forward the whole query string.
- The manifest route passes `cache-control`, `etag`, `last-modified` and `content-language` through, sends an adjusted `age`, and answers a matching `If-None-Match` with `304`. It never adds a `cache-control` header the backend did not send.
- The init route negotiates the policy contract in every adapter (before, only Next.js and Nuxt did), always answers with `x-c15t-policy-contract: 1`, and echoes `resolvedOverrides` and `resolvedPrivacySignals` (Next.js did not). A resolution that did not match carries no `policySnapshotToken`, `gvl`, `gvlReference`, `cmpId` or `customVendors`.
- A vendor list that cannot be loaded fails the init request. Astro answered `gvl: null`, which the browser reads as "IAB is off". The default vendor-list fetch now goes through the shared server cache with a five-second deadline. SvelteKit and Astro used an uncached fetch, and SvelteKit's had no deadline.
- When the manifest cannot be read and `backendURL` is set, the init route asks the backend's own `/init` and passes on its `vendors`, `vendorListVersion` and `resolvedPrivacySignals`. This covers backends without `/manifest`. It was Nuxt-only.
- A session report is skipped when the request was aborted before the route answered, in every adapter. The rest of an aborted request goes to the platform's `waitUntil`.
- `x-c15t-timeout-ms` on an init request bounds the manifest read, the vendor list and the `/init` fallback, in every adapter. Nuxt's server render already sent it.
- With `proxy` on, the manifest request carries the cookies `cookieNames` names and the extra `forwardHeaders` in SvelteKit too, not only TanStack Start, and a manifest read with them is answered `private, no-store`.
- On a catch-all route, `init` or the route root answers init, `manifest` answers the manifest, and any other path is proxied with `proxy` on or answers `404`. SvelteKit used to answer other paths with init. TanStack Start now answers the route root with init.

`fetchCachedGvl` from `@c15t/core/server` now reads and fills the same process cache as the one from `@c15t/core`, instead of a separate one.

**Breaking.**

- `@c15t/nextjs/api` no longer exports `fetchCachedManifest`, `getSMaxAge` or `ManifestFetchResult`. Use `fetchCachedManifest` from `@c15t/core/server`. `manifestGET` no longer substitutes `public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=86400` when the backend sends no `cache-control`, and no longer sends `x-c15t-next-revalidate`. Its configuration error now reads `@c15t/nextjs: pass backendURL or manifestURL.`
- In `@c15t/astro/api`, `resolveManifestInit` rejects when an IAB policy's vendor list cannot be loaded instead of returning `gvl: null`, and the `FetchGvl` callback receives `fetch` typed as `typeof globalThis.fetch`. The server render then leaves the policy to the browser.
- In `@c15t/svelte/kit`, a catch-all route answers `404` for any path other than `init`, `manifest` or the route root, unless `proxy` is on. It used to answer those paths with init. Migration: send init requests to `<route>/init` or the route root; c15t's own clients already do.
