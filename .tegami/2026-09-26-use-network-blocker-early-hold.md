### `useNetworkBlocker` holds matching requests from its first render

The standalone `useNetworkBlocker` hook installed the blocker from a mount effect. Effects in the calling component's children, and in components rendered before it, run first, so matching `fetch` and XHR requests sent from them went out without a consent check on first visits and for visitors who had rejected. The hook now holds matching requests from the first render of the component that calls it, the same way the provider's `networkBlocker` option does since the previous release, and the blocker decides them once it loads.

Holds are now tracked per caller. When a page uses both the provider option and the hook, one blocker loading or one component unmounting no longer releases requests that the other's rules still hold.

#### Migration

The hook's first render in the browser now has a side effect: it patches `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to hold requests that match its rules. On the server it still does nothing. If React discards that render and never commits it (a render that throws, or an attempt thrown away while suspending), the hold ends after 10 seconds and the requests it held are sent, as they would have been without the hook. No code changes are needed. If a test asserts that `window.fetch` is untouched after rendering a component that calls the hook, update it: during the first render `window.fetch` is the hold's wrapper, and after the blocker loads it is the blocker's.
