### Render theme CSS on the server

**Breaking.** The browser no longer generates theme CSS. `ConsentProvider` (and `ConsentRoot`) used to turn `options.theme` tokens into a `<style id="c15t-theme">` element on every page, so every visitor downloaded the theme generator and the default theme, about 1.7 KB gzip. The package stylesheet already carries the default tokens, so the provider now renders no theme style at all.

Render custom tokens with the new `ConsentTheme` component, exported from `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`, `@c15t/tanstack-start` and the `c15t/react`, `c15t/next` and `c15t/tanstack-start` entries. It is not a client component: render it from a Server Component and the generator stays on the server. `ConsentTheme` takes `theme`, `colorScheme` (`'light'`, `'dark'` or `'system'`, applied before hydration) and `nonce`. `generateThemeCSS()` from `@c15t/ui/theme` now escapes `<`, so its output is safe inside a `<style>` element wherever you render it.

`@c15t/svelte`'s provider no longer injects the token CSS after hydration, which also removes the one-frame flash of default colors in SvelteKit. `@c15t/astro` now renders the integration's `theme` tokens on the server, next to the config script, instead of leaving them to the dialog islands.

#### Migration

- **Next.js App Router.** Move the theme to a module without `'use client'`. Render `<ConsentTheme theme={theme} />` in the root layout (a Server Component) next to your consent wrapper, and pass `colorScheme` and `nonce` there if you set them on `ConsentRoot`. Keep `options.theme` on `ConsentRoot` only for `consentActions` and slot styles.
- **Next.js Pages Router.** Render `ConsentTheme` in `pages/_document.tsx`.
- **TanStack Start.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from a `createServerFn` handler in the root loader and render it in a `<style id="c15t-theme">` in the head. Rendering `ConsentTheme` in the root component also works but ships the generator.
- **React without server rendering.** Render `ConsentTheme` next to the provider (this ships the generator), or put the output of `generateThemeCSS(theme)` in your stylesheet.
- **SvelteKit.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from `+layout.server.ts` and render it inside `<svelte:head>`. Keep slot styles and `consentActions` in `options.theme`.
- **Astro.** Keep tokens in the integration's `theme`. Tokens in the client entrypoint's `theme` are no longer applied.
- **Light and dark at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` without `colorScheme` and toggle the `dark` class on `<html>` (for example with next-themes): its output holds both schemes. The provider's `colorScheme` option still keeps the `c15t-dark` class in sync after hydration.
- **Switching token sets at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` from a client component and change its props.
- Keep importing the package stylesheet. It holds the default tokens the provider used to inject.

In development, the provider warns when `theme` holds tokens but the page has no `c15t-theme` stylesheet.
