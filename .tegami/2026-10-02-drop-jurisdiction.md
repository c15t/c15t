### Remove the v2 `jurisdiction` label and `disableGeoLocation`

v3 decides consent from policy rules, so the regulation label v2 derived from a fixed country table (`GDPR`, `CCPA`, `NONE` and so on) is gone from the API.

- `/init` responses and session reports no longer carry `jurisdiction`, so `sessions.onReport` no longer receives it. Read the matched policy from `policyResolution`, or the report's `policy`, `country` and `region`.
- `@c15t/schema` removes `jurisdictionCodes`, `jurisdictionCodeSchema`, `JurisdictionCode` and `checkJurisdiction`. `@c15t/core` and `c15t` remove the unused `LocationInfo`, `ConsentBannerResponse` and `JurisdictionCode` types.
- The `disableGeoLocation` manifest option is removed. To show every visitor the same banner, configure one policy rule with `match: { isDefault: true }`; the browser resolves it without a location. To test a region's rule, set the country in the client's `overrides`, for example `overrides: { country: 'US' }`.
- The `/init` translations schema is now one shape with optional keys. `completeTranslationsSchema`, `partialTranslationsSchema` and the `partial*` section schemas are removed, along with the deprecated `frame` key, which the backend already folds into `consentGate`. `titleDescriptionSchema` now accepts a pair with `title` or `description` missing, so its inferred type has both fields optional.
- The backend still accepts `jurisdiction` in a save request from a 2.x client and ignores it. Policy snapshot tokens no longer carry the claim, and tokens that still do are accepted.
- Migration 7 makes `runtimePolicyDecision.jurisdiction` nullable; new decisions store `null` and 2.x rows keep their value. Apply it with `@c15t/cli self-host migrate --apply` before deploying this backend.
