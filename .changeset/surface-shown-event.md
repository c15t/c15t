Report banner and dialog impressions, not only choices. The kernel emits a `surface:shown` event when the banner or the dialog becomes visible and records the first impression time of each surface in `snapshot.surfaceShownAt`, so a late subscriber can still read it. Provider callbacks gain `onSurfaceShown`; `@c15t/browser` dispatches `c15t:surfaceShown`; dev-tools log the event. A recorded choice now carries `timeToDecisionMs` (impression to action) on the `choice:recorded` event, on `onChoiceRecorded`, and on the saved consent as `metadata.timeToDecisionMs`. `kernel.commands.save()` accepts a `uiSource` override, and the React `uiSource` prop now reaches the save payload, so `ConsentWidget` saves are attributed to `widget` instead of the active banner. The never-fired `onBannerFetched` callback and `OnBannerFetchedPayload` type are removed.
