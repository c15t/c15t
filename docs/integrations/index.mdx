## Overview

Many of your tools may require consent to be given before they can be used. This is especially true for analytics and marketing tools.

c15t has various ways to integrate with your tools, depending on the tool you are using.

## Script Loader

Many marketing and analytics tools are commonly loaded using a script tag, such as Google Tag Manager (GTM), Google Tag (gtag.js), Meta Pixel and TikTok Pixel.

c15t's script loader allows you to easily integrate your tools that require consent with c15t, to make this even easier we have provided a set of prebuilt scripts for you to use.

## has() method

The `has()` method allows you to check if the user has given consent for a specific purpose. You can learn more about the `has()` method [here](/docs/frameworks/javascript/store/checking-consent).

```ts


const hasAnalytics = has('measurement');

if (hasAnalytics) {
  myAnalyticsLibrary.track('checkout_completed');
}
```
