Tailwind supports customizing components using Tailwind CSS. You can use Tailwind's utility classes to customize the appearance of c15t's components.

```bg-red-500``` 

## Tailwind CSS v3

Tailwind CSS v3.x does not use CSS Layers for its core utilities. Since our components use the `@layer c15t` layer, Tailwind's unlayered utilities will always take precedence automatically causing our pre-defined styles to be overridden.

To ensure our pre-defined styles are applied, you need to wrap your Tailwind configuration in a `@layer base, components;` layer.
```css
@layer base, components;

@layer base {
  @tailwind base;
}

@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
