## Overview

Callbacks allow you to execute custom code in response to various consent management events. They provide a way to integrate consent management with your application's logic, analytics, and other features.

## Available Callbacks

The following callbacks are available your the c15t config.

### Callback Reference

- `onError`: Called when an API request fails.
- `onConsentBannerFetched`: Called after successfully fetching the consent banner information.
- `onConsentSet`: Called after successfully setting consent preferences.
- `onConsentVerified`: Called after successfully verifying consent.

### Offline Mode Callbacks

Some callbacks require a call to an endpoint meaning they will not work fully in offline mode.

- `onConsentBannerFetched`: Will always return a simulated response of true, unless consent is in local storage.
- `onConsentSet`: Stores consent in local storage.
- `onConsentVerified`: Will always return a simulated response of true, unless consent is in local storage.



## Usage Examples

```typescript
import { configureConsentManager, type ConsentManagerOptions } from 'c15t';

const c15tConfig: ConsentManagerOptions = {
  // ...
  callbacks: {
    onConsentSet: ({ data }) => {
      if (data.preferences.measurement) {
        // Add your scripts here to enable analytics
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Callback Response Types

Callback responses are always of type `ResponseContext<T>`. 

<AutoTypeTable path="./packages/core/c15t/src/client/types.ts" name="ResponseContext" />

### onConsentSet Data

The `onConsentSet` callback receives consent preference details:

<AutoTypeTable path="./packages/core/src/client/client-interface.ts" name="ConsentSetCallbackPayload" />

### onConsentVerified Data

The `onConsentVerified` callback receives verification results:

<AutoTypeTable path="./packages/core/c15t/src/client/client-interface.ts" name="ConsentVerifiedCallbackPayload" />

### onConsentBannerFetched Data

The `onConsentBannerFetched` callback receives banner information:

<AutoTypeTable path="./packages/core/src/client/client-interface.ts" name="ConsentBannerFetchedCallbackPayload" />
