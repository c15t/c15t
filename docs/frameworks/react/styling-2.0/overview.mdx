## Overview

c15t components use a modern styling system built on **Design Tokens**, **Smart Defaults**, and **Component Slots**. This system provides a balance between ease of use for simple brand changes and deep customization for complex design requirements.

## Core Architecture

The system is structured into two levels of customization:

### Level 1: Design Tokens
Design tokens are the global foundation of your theme. They define the core values for colors, typography, spacing, and borders that apply across all c15t components.

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    theme: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#0066ff',
        surface: '#ffffff',
        text: '#111111',
      },
      typography: {
        fontFamily: 'Inter, sans-serif',
      },
      radius: {
        md: '12px',
      },
    }
  }}
>
  {children}
</ConsentManagerProvider>
```

### Level 2: Component Slots
For fine-grained control, you can target specific elements within a component using slots. This allows you to add custom classes or specific inline styles to individual parts of the UI without affecting the global design tokens.

```tsx
theme: {
  slots: {
    bannerCard: 'my-custom-card-class',
    buttonPrimary: {
      className: 'font-bold px-6',
      style: { textTransform: 'uppercase' }
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

- **Semantic Naming**: Tokens use names like `primary`, `surface`, and `textMuted` to reflect design intent rather than component implementation.
- **Smart Inheritance**: Components automatically inherit global tokens, so setting your `primary` color once updates all buttons and interactive elements.
- **Animation Synchronization**: Component unmounting and visibility transitions are automatically synchronized with your `motion` tokens, ensuring smooth animations without hardcoded timeouts.
- **Type-Safe Discovery**: The entire theme object is strictly typed, providing full autocomplete and build-time validation for all tokens and slots.
