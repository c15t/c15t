[consent.io](https://consent.io) provides a fully managed consent management service, offering the easiest way to implement robust server-based consent storage with minimal setup and maintenance.

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Backend Maintenance** - No server setup or management required
- **Automatic Updates** - Always running the latest version
- **Built-in Scaling** - Handles traffic spikes without configuration
- **Geographic Detection** - Built-in jurisdiction detection for compliance
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Insights into consent patterns and compliance

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create a consent.io Instance

    1. Sign up for a [consent.io](https://consent.io) account
    2. Create a new instance in the dashboard
    3. Configure your trusted origins (domains that can connect to your instance)
    4. Copy the provided backendURL (e.g., `https://your-instance.c15t.dev`)

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure Your Client

    Set up your frontend to use the consent.io instance:

    ```tsx
    // app/layout.tsx
    import {
      ConsentManagerDialog,
      ConsentManagerProvider,
      CookieBanner
    } from '@c15t/react';

    export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
      return (
    			<ConsentManagerProvider
    				options={{
    					mode: 'c15t',
    					backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
    					consentCategories: ['necessary', 'marketing'], // Optional: Specify which consent categories to show in the banner.
    					ignoreGeoLocation: true, // Useful for development to always view the banner.
    				}}
    			>
          {children}
          <CookieBanner />
          <ConsentManagerDialog />
        </ConsentManagerProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Test Your Integration

    1. Run your application
    2. Verify the consent banner appears
    3. Check the consent.io dashboard to confirm data is being recorded

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternative: Self-Hosting

If you need complete control over your consent management infrastructure, you can self-host a c15t instance instead of using consent.io.

<Callout type="warning">
  Self-hosting requires more setup and maintenance effort but gives you complete
  control over your data and infrastructure.
