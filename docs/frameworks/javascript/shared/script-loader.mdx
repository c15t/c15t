<section id="tracking-blocker">
  <Callout type="note">
    When using the Script Loader, the tracking blocker will be disabled automatically (If enabled). This is because the tracking blocker is deprecated and may cause conflicts with the script loader.
    The current approach of the tracking blocker will only be available in v1.x of c15t, and will be removed in v2.0.

  ## Overview

  c15t provides the ability to load and unload scripts based on consent. This is useful for loading scripts that are not necessary for the user's consent, such as analytics scripts.

  One common flaw of CMPs is they'll maintain a list of scripts that are blocked and then unblocked based on consent. This is a problem because it's not always accurate and can lead to scripts being missed or incorrectly blocked.

  Our approach gives you, the developer, full control over the scripts that are loaded and unloaded, as no one knows your site better than you do.
