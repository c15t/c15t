## How It Works

<Callout type="note">
  Offline mode provides the same API interface as the standard client but operates completely client-side.
</Callout>

The offline mode implements the same interface as the standard client, but with the following differences:

1. **Storage**: All consent preferences are stored in the browser's localStorage using the configured key
2. **Network**: No network requests are made, all operations happen locally
3. **Consent Banner**: The banner visibility is determined by checking if a value exists in localStorage
4. **Consent Verification**: Always returns a successful response
