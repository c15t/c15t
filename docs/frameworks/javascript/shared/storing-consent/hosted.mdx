## Managed Service vs Self-Hosting

Using [consent.io](https://consent.io) is the easiest way to get started with c15t. It's a fully managed service that removes all the infrastructure complexity. You can focus on your application while we handle scaling, updates, and compliance monitoring. For organizations with specific requirements, we also offer [self-hosting](/docs/storing-consent/self-hosting) options.

## Implementation

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { 
  ConsentManagerDialog,
  ConsentManagerProvider,
  CookieBanner,
} from '@c15t/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider options={{  
      mode: 'c15t', 
      backendURL: process.env.C15T_URL,
      consentCategories: ['necessary', 'marketing'], // Optional: Specify which consent categories to show in the banner. 
      ignoreGeoLocation: true, // Useful for development to always view the banner.
    }}>
      <div className="App">
        {/* Your application content */}
      </div>
      <CookieBanner />
      <ConsentManagerDialog />
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
