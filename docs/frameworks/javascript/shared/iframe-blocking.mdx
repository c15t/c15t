<section id="overview">
  ## Overview

  Iframe blocking is a feature that allows you to block iframes based on consent. This is useful for blocking iframes that are not allowed to load until consent is given.
  This should be used when an iframe sets cookies such as a YouTube embed.

  ## Headless Usage

  ```html
  // Will render immediately - No blocking
  <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/unblocked" />

  // Does not render until consent is granted
  <iframe data-src="https://youtube.com/embed/123" data-category="marketing" />
  ```

  <Callout type="note">
    The iframe blocker will only block iframes that have a `data-category` & `data-src` attribute.

    No fallback is provided for blocked iframes using this method.
