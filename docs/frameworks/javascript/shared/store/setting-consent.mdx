### setSelectedConsent()

This method sets a user's consent choice but doesn't save it.

```tsx
setSelectedConsent('marketing', true) 
```

### saveConsents()

This method should be called after the user saves there consent preferences, e.g. an accept all button or dialog save.
This function handles logic such as calling backend and the `onConsentSet` callback.

```tsx
saveConsents('all') // User has accepted to all
saveConsents('custom') // Uses the consents set by setSelectedConsent()
saveConsents('necessary') // User rejects all 
```

### setConsent()

Useful for buttons like "Enable Marketing Consent", this will save the user's new consent by calling `saveConsents()`.

```tsx
setSelectedConsent('marketing', true) 
```
