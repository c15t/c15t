## Overview

c15t supports internationalization (i18n) through the `translations` property in the `ConsentManagerOptions` object and has support for both server-side and client-side rendering.

| The best way to reduce bundle size and improve performance. We can detect the user's language based on the browser's language settings, allowing for the most accurate translations. By default, when using a [Consent.io](https://consent.io) hosted instance, [these languages](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/tree/main/packages/translations/src/translations) are supported. | Bundled with the application allowing for multiple languages to be supported without the need for a backend. The more translations you have, the larger the bundle size will be, which may impact the performance of your application. |

c15t also supports partial translations, which means you can adjust a single translation without having to pass the entire translations object. It will fallback to using the language, if the language is not supported.

The client-side translation is also prioritized over the server-side translation, so you can override the server-side translation with a client-side translation.
