## 📅 Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables | Go/No-Go Criteria |
|-------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | 8 days | Core analytics + PostHog/Console | All tests passing, basic analytics working |
| Phase 2 | 7 days | Universal destinations + scripts | Meta Pixel + GA4 working end-to-end |
| Phase 3 | 8 days | Cloud configuration + admin UI | Admin UI functional, database config working |
| Phase 4 | 7 days | Unified consent + migration | Migration complete, event-sidekick deprecated |

**Total Duration**: 30 days  
**Buffer**: 5 days (for unexpected issues)  
**Total Project**: 35 days

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Standard Schema Complexity**: Start with Zod-only, add Standard Schema later
2. **Performance Regression**: Benchmark early and often
3. **Integration Issues**: Test with real APIs early
4. **Database Migration**: Test migrations on staging first

### Business Risks
1. **User Disruption**: Gradual rollout with feature flags
2. **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup strategy
3. **Compliance Issues**: Legal review of consent handling
4. **Timeline Overrun**: Phase gates with go/no-go decisions

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for all new code
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Type definitions and interfaces
  - Destination implementations
  - Event processing logic
  - API handlers

### Integration Tests
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Full analytics flow (event → destination)
  - Database operations
  - API endpoints
  - Script generation

### E2E Tests
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - Complete user journey (consent → analytics)
  - Multi-destination scenarios
  - Error handling flows
  - Migration scenarios

### Performance Tests
- **Benchmarks**:
  - Event processing latency vs event-sidekick
  - Memory usage with lazy loading
  - Database query performance
  - Script generation speed
