## Choosing the Right Adapter

- **Memory Adapter**: Perfect for development, testing, and demos. Not suitable for production.
- **Kysely Adapter**: Great for applications that need direct SQL access with type safety and performance.
- **Prisma Adapter**: Ideal for applications that benefit from a full-featured ORM with schema management.
- **Drizzle Adapter**: Good balance between performance and features with a lightweight footprint.

## Migration Path

You can switch between adapters as your application needs evolve:

1. **Development â†’ Production**: Start with Memory adapter, then migrate to Kysely, Prisma, or Drizzle
2. **Changing Adapters**: The common adapter interface makes it relatively easy to switch between implementations
