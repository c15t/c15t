import { RiFileCopyLine, RiFlashlightLine, RiServerLine, RiWifiOffLine, RiSettings4Line } from '@remixicon/react';


## How to add callbacks
Due to the nature of Next.js App Directory, we have to define callbacks to run in a client component.

```ts title="app/layout.client.tsx"
'use client';

import { ConsentManagerCallbacks } from '@c15t/nextjs/client';

export function ClientLayout() {
	return (
		<ConsentManagerCallbacks
			callbacks={{
				onBannerFetched(response) {
					console.log('Consent banner fetched', response);
				},
				onConsentSet(response) {
					console.log('Consent has been saved locally', response);
				},
				onError(response) {
					console.log('Error', response);
				},
			}}
		/>
	);
}
```

<Callout type="note">
Ensure you import this component inside the ConsentManagerProvider component in your `app/layout.tsx` file.
</Callout>

## Available callbacks

### onBannerFetched

This callback is called when the consent banner is fetched, it is not called when the banner is set to `offline` mode.

### onConsentSet

This callback is called when the consent is set.

### onError

This callback is called when an error occurs.
