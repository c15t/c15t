title: Auto-Detect Functionality
---

## Overview

The auto-detect functionality is designed to dynamically manage the display of the cookie consent banner based on the user's geographical location. This ensures compliance with various international data protection regulations, such as GDPR, PIPEDA, and others.

## How It Works

### Location Detection

- The system uses HTTP headers to determine the user's country and region. These headers may include:
  - `cf-ipcountry`
  - `x-vercel-ip-country`
  - `x-amz-cf-ipcountry`
  - `x-country-code`
  - `x-vercel-ip-country-region`
  - `x-region-code`

### Jurisdiction Check

- Once the location is determined, the system checks the jurisdiction against a predefined set of rules to decide whether a cookie banner is required.
- Jurisdictions include:
  - **GDPR**: Applies to EU, EEA, UK
  - **PIPEDA**: Applies to Canada
  - **LGPD**: Applies to Brazil
  - **APPI**: Applies to Japan
  - **PIPA**: Applies to South Korea
  - **Australia's Privacy Act**: Applies to Australia

### Display Logic

- If the user's location falls under a jurisdiction that requires consent, the cookie banner is displayed.
- If no specific requirements are detected, the banner is not shown.

## Implementation Details

### Middleware Integration

- The middleware handles the detection and jurisdiction check, returning a response that includes:
  - `showConsentBanner`: A boolean indicating whether to show the banner.
  - `jurisdiction`: An object containing the jurisdiction code and message.
  - `location`: An object with the user's country and region codes.

### API Endpoint

- The `/show-consent-banner` endpoint is responsible for processing the request and returning the appropriate response based on the user's location.

## Conclusion

The auto-detect functionality ensures that users are presented with a cookie consent banner only when necessary, aligning with global privacy regulations. This approach not only enhances user experience by reducing unnecessary prompts but also maintains compliance with legal requirements.
