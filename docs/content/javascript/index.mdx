## Introduction

The `c15t` package is a powerful headless library that transforms privacy consent management into a fully observable system. Built with modern web applications in mind, it provides a robust foundation for implementing privacy-compliant consent management while giving developers complete control over the user interface.

### Key Features

- **🎯 Zero UI Dependencies**: A truly headless solution that doesn't impose any UI constraints
- **⚡️ High Performance**: Optimized state management with minimal overhead
- **🔄 Real-time Updates**: Instant state synchronization across your application
- **🛡️ Type-safe**: Built with TypeScript for enhanced developer experience
- **📦 Lightweight**: Small bundle size with zero dependencies
- **🔌 Framework Agnostic**: Works with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JS

## Why Use c15t?

- **Headless Architecture**: Provides the core logic and state management for consent without imposing any UI constraints, allowing developers to build custom interfaces tailored to their application's needs.
- **Custom UI Development**: Perfect for teams that want to design their own consent interfaces while leveraging robust backend logic.
- **Flexibility and Control**: Offers complete control over how consents are displayed and managed, enabling seamless integration with existing systems and workflows.

## Installation

To install the package, use one of the following commands:

```package-install
c15t
```

### Basic Setup

To create a consent manager store, import and use the `createConsentManagerStore` function. This store will handle all consent-related state and logic:

```typescript
import { createConsentManagerStore } from 'c15t';

const store = createConsentManagerStore();

// Subscribe to state changes
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(
  state => console.log('Consent updated:', state.consents)
);

// Update consent
store.getState().setConsent('analytics', true);
```

## State Management

The store provides several methods to manage consent states:

```typescript
// Get current consent state
const analyticsConsent = store.getState().consents.analytics;

// Subscribe to specific consent changes
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(
  state => {
    if (state.consents.analytics) {
      // Initialize analytics
    }
  }
);

// Batch update multiple consents
store.getState().setConsents({
  analytics: true,
  marketing: false
});

// Save current consent state
store.getState().saveConsents();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Early Initialization**: Initialize the consent manager as early as possible in your application lifecycle.
   ```typescript
   // In your app's entry point
   const store = createConsentManagerStore();
   ```

2. **Consent Persistence**: Always handle consent persistence properly:
   ```typescript
    const store = createConsentManagerStore();

   // Save consents when user confirms choices
   function handleConsentConfirmation() {
     store.getState().saveConsents();
   }
   ```

## Example Implementation using Vanilla JavaScript

This is a basic example of how to implement the consent manager store to create a cookie banner using vanilla JavaScript.

### Use Cases

1. **Custom Consent UI**: Use the core library to manage consent logic while building a custom UI that matches your application's design language.
2. **Integration with Analytics**: Seamlessly integrate consent management with analytics tools to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
3. **Dynamic Consent Management**: Adjust consent options dynamically based on user location or preferences, using the library's flexible API.

### Managing Consents

You can manage user consents using various methods provided by the store:

<Tabs groupId="Method" items={["Set Consent", "Save Consents", "Reset Consents"]}>
<Tab value="Set Consent">
Update consent for a specific type.
  ```typescript
  import { createConsentManagerStore } from 'c15t';
 
  const store = createConsentManagerStore();
 
  store.getState().setConsent('marketing', true);
  ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Save Consents">
Save user preferences.
  ```typescript
  import { createConsentManagerStore } from 'c15t';
 
  const store = createConsentManagerStore();
 
  store.getState().saveConsents('all');
  ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Reset Consents">
 Reset all consents to default values.
  ```typescript
  import { createConsentManagerStore } from 'c15t';
 
  const store = createConsentManagerStore();
 
  store.getState().resetConsents();
  ```
</Tab>
