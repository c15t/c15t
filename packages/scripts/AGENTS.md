# @c15t/scripts

> Consent-aware vendor integrations and Consent Mode loading contracts.

These docs ship inside the package so coding agents can read them offline. Open the topic file you need from the list below — paths are relative to this file.

## Using these docs

These docs describe c15t v3. Find the app in Choose your setup, then follow that framework guide from start to finish; it names the files to create and the backend URL to use. Install c15t packages with the @alpha dist-tag, because npm latest is still v2. A visible banner does not prove anything: check that vendor requests wait for consent, that rejection survives a reload, and that preferences can be reopened.

## Start here

- [Connect your integrations](./docs/integrations/overview.md)
- [Choose your setup](./docs/concepts/choose-your-setup.md): Pick the c15t setup for your framework, rendering mode and hosting, and decide who runs the consent backend.
- [How consent works](./docs/concepts/how-consent-works.md): What c15t decides on each page load, the difference between a permission and a recorded choice, and what happens when a visitor saves.
- [Customize your consent interface](./docs/customization/overview.md): Choose presentation, theme tokens, slots or custom markup for the change you need.
- [Verify consent before shipping](./docs/guides/verify-consent.md): Check in a production build that vendor requests wait for consent, rejection survives a reload, preferences reopen and privacy signals apply.
- [Migrate from v2 to v3](./docs/upgrade-v3.md): Upgrade a c15t v2 app to v3. Covers packages, the Next.js and React providers, the JavaScript runtime, custom UI built on useConsentManager, callbacks, policies, stored consent and a self-hosted backend.
