  ## üìã Detailed Change Breakdown

  ### **New Features**

  - Added multi-language support for consent banners with new translations in German, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian, Dutch, and Portuguese.

  - Introduced new CLI global flag for telemetry debug mode.

  ### **Improvements**

  - Consent banner responses now include detailed translation structures and jurisdiction information.
  - Translation utilities and types centralized in a new `@c15t/translations` package for easier integration.

  ### **Tests**

  - Added extensive tests for consent banner display logic, jurisdiction detection, language preference parsing, and translation selection.
  - Removed deprecated tests for deleted middleware and jurisdiction modules.

  ### **Chores**

  - Updated package versions and dependencies to latest canary releases, including addition of `@c15t/translations`.
