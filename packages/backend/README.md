The backend for c15t. You can self-host this backend to store & manage users consent preferences. 

We recommend using [consent.io](https://consent.io) instead of self hosting so the infrastructure is managed for you.

## Getting Started

View our [self-hosting guide](https://c15t.com/docs/self-host) for more information.

## Features

- 📝 **Consent Management**: Track and manage user consent preferences
- 🌐 **Geo-Location**: Identify user's location to show relevant consent preferences, e.g. cookie banner only in EU.
- ⚡ **Server-Side Translation**: Reduce the bundle size of your banner by translating consent preferences on the server.
- 🔍 **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all consent-related actions
- 🔄 **Domain Management**: Handle multiple domains and subdomains
- 📝 **Policy Management**: Version and manage consent policies
