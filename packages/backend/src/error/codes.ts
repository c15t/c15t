/**
 * Standardized error codes for the c15t consent management system.
 *
 * These error codes are used throughout the application to provide consistent
 * error messages and enable proper error handling in client applications.
 * Each error code represents a specific type of error that can occur during
 * consent management operations.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { BASE_ERROR_CODES, C15TError } from '@c15t/error';
 *
 * // Handle a specific error
 * try {
 *   await consentManager.updateConsent(consentId, preferences);
 * } catch (error) {
 *   if (error instanceof C15TError && error.code === BASE_ERROR_CODES.CONSENT_NOT_FOUND) {
 *     // Handle the specific case where consent is not found
 *     console.error('Cannot update: consent record does not exist');
 *   } else {
 *     // Handle other errors
 *     console.error('Failed to update consent:', error.message);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
