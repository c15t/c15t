	 * directly against the connected database. If any migration fails, the
	 * process is halted with an error.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Migrations are executed in the order they were added to the migrations array.
	 * Column additions are typically executed before table creations to ensure
	 * any references between them are properly established.
	 *
	 * Error handling includes:
	 * - Detailed logging of which migration failed
	 * - Capturing the exact SQL that caused the error
	 * - Rethrowing the error to allow callers to implement recovery strategies
	 *
	 * @throws Will throw the original database error with additional context
	 *
	 * @returns A promise that resolves when all migrations are complete
	 *
	 * @example
	 * ```typescript
	 * try {
	 *   await runMigrations();
	 *   console.log('All migrations completed successfully');
	 * } catch (error) {
	 *   console.error('Migration failed:', error);
	 * }
