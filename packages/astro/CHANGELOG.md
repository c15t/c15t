## @c15t/astro@3.0.0-alpha.3 (alpha)

### Keep visitors' choices on prerendered Astro pages

A prerendered page no longer reads the build request's headers or cookie. The
page used to carry the build's empty consent record, which the browser
preferred over the visitor's stored cookie, so every reload asked again. The
browser now reads the visitor's own cookie. Astro's warning about reading
`Astro.request.headers` on a prerendered page is gone too.

### Explain why the injected Astro routes need an adapter

`manifest()` mode, or `endpoints: true` in any mode, injects on-demand init and
manifest routes. On a site with no server adapter, `astro build` stopped with a
generic "no adapter" error that never mentioned those routes. The integration
now fails the build first, names the routes, and says how to build statically.
`astro dev` and `astro sync` still run without an adapter, as Astro allows.

### Encode and enforce IAB publisher restrictions

Configure TCF publisher restrictions with `publisherRestrictions` on `createIAB`, `IABProvider`, the runtime's `iab` options or the Astro integration's `iab` options. c15t writes them into the TC string's `PubRestrictions` section, decodes them from stored strings, and reports them through `__tcfapi('getTCData')` as `publisher.restrictions`. Previously that map was always empty and configured restrictions were not encoded.

Consent-gated scripts, network rules and iframes with a `vendorId` now apply the confirmed restrictions: type 0 blocks the purpose, type 1 requires consent and type 2 requires legitimate interest for purposes the vendor list marks as flexible. Accept all grants the vendor signal a restriction needs. Legitimate interest a restriction introduces applies until the visitor objects, so Save Settings encodes it as allowed, matching what the preference centres show.

The React, Vue, Svelte and `@c15t/browser/iab` preference centres list each vendor under the legal basis the restrictions leave it, so a vendor moved to legitimate interest gets an objection control instead of a consent toggle. A purpose whose vendors all use legitimate interest shows no consent switch, only the objection, and display-model rows report this as `hasConsentBasis`. Such a purpose no longer decides its c15t category, so a granular save no longer records a denial that blocks its legitimate-interest vendors; legitimate interest never grants a category on its own. Custom UIs can use `applyPublisherRestrictionsToGVL` from `@c15t/iab/headless` or pass `publisherRestrictions` to `processGVLForDialog`.

IAB gates no longer let a refused c15t category block a target that uses only legitimate interest after publisher restrictions. Such a target needs no consent under TCF, so its purpose and vendor legitimate interest signals, and the visitor's objection, decide. Previously every restriction on a referenced category blocked IAB targets; GPC, opt-out directives and strict scope still do, and the refused category still blocks scripts that name only the category or declare a consent purpose.

Unsupported restrictions throw `PublisherRestrictionError` instead of being dropped. This covers reserved type 3, vendors or purposes missing from the vendor list, legitimate interest for purposes 1 and 3 to 6, basis changes on purposes the vendor does not declare as flexible, conflicting types for one vendor, and restrictions in a string that is not service-specific. `whenReady()`, `save()` and `generateTCString()` reject, and no TC string is written. Retrying `whenReady()` does not fetch another vendor list. With an explicit `gvl`, the error lasts for the handle and saving keeps failing even if the kernel later holds a different list; a CMP following the kernel's list checks a replacement list again. When a replacement vendor list makes a restriction unsupported, the TC authority confirmed under the previous list is cleared. Whenever the CMP withdraws its own authority, including on expiry, it also removes the `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry. A stored TC string whose restrictions differ from the configuration is not restored; the banner opens again for a returning visitor and closes once they save, IAB gates stay denied until then, and the superseded `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry are removed. Decoding a string written under TCF policy version 2 or 3 accepts legitimate interest required for purposes 3 to 6, which those versions allowed.

### Accept Astro 6 and 7

`@c15t/astro` now lists `astro` 5, 6 and 7 as peer dependencies, so package
managers stop warning when you install it into a current Astro project.

On the Cloudflare adapter for Astro 6 and later, background manifest refreshes
and session reports now use `waitUntil` from `Astro.locals.cfContext`. They
still use `Astro.locals.runtime.ctx` on Astro 5.

### Keep open tabs in step with stored consent

A choice saved in one tab now reaches the other open tabs on the same origin
without a reload. Before, a tab kept a grant after another tab stored a denial,
and neither `kernel.refresh()` nor `runtime.reinit()` read storage again.

Browser persistence reads stored records again when another tab on the same
origin changes a c15t localStorage key, when the page becomes visible and when
the window regains focus. A tab on another subdomain that shares the consent
cookie gets no `storage` event and catches up on its next focus or visibility
change, and so does every tab when localStorage is unavailable and only the
cookie is stored. Category decisions merge per category, keeping the newer decision for
each, and privacy directives merge as a union. A stored notice or vendor record
replaces the one in memory unless it is older. A record removed from storage is
cleared, so the active policy decides again. Blocked storage or bytes that do
not decode change nothing. Reconnecting does not read storage.

Queued writes follow the same rules. A tab lands its own pending write before it
reads, a choice write stores the per-category merge with what storage holds, a
directive write keeps every stored directive, and the rewrite that adds a
server subject id no longer recreates records another tab cleared. When two
tabs act in the same millisecond, the record stored first wins in both. A
tab that opened before another stored a subject joins the stored subject
unless it identified a different user; a subject id the server resolved is
kept unless a strictly newer stored choice carries another one. Only a
record this tab saw in storage is cleared when it disappears, so a choice
seeded while storage was blocked survives storage becoming readable.

Under an IAB policy, `@c15t/iab` loads the TC string another tab stored once
its choice is reconciled, with its purpose, vendor and special-feature
selections, so `__tcfapi` and the preference controls no longer show the
previous choice. Selections changed in this tab without saving are kept. A
TC string that grants any purpose of a category denied after it was saved
is withdrawn and not restored on the next page load; a partial purpose
selection saved through IAB keeps its TC string. A TC string confirmed before
the reconciled choice's newest decision, such as after a save on a sibling
subdomain that shares the consent cookie, is withdrawn as well, since the TC
string and its receipt belong to one origin. A newer receipt replaces the held
one even when the TC string is identical.

Clearing records now stores the clear epoch, the time of the clear, under
`c15t-epoch` in localStorage and a cookie of the same name, and clearing never
removes it. Every consent record written afterwards records its epoch too.
Decisions confirmed before the epoch are void everywhere: a tab that reconciles
after another tab cleared and saved again drops its pre-clear decisions, a tab
that missed the clear cannot write them back, and browser hydration and server
reads (`readStoredRecordsFromCookieHeader`) ignore them. A decision in the
clearing millisecond counts only from a tab that had seen the clear. Each clear
moves the epoch forward even after the clock went back, and an epoch up to an
hour ahead of the clock is kept. Records from before any clear, including v2
and legacy records, read as epoch 0 and are unaffected; a corrupt epoch also
reads as 0, and a record whose epoch field is corrupt is kept.

The consent cookie stays authoritative, but a denial in its localStorage copy
that is newer than the cookie's decision is now applied on top of it, so a
dropped cookie write no longer keeps an older grant in force. Copies written
under different clear epochs are cut to the later epoch first, and the
subject comes from the later copy. Privacy directives from both copies of the
privacy record apply, a newer local vendor list adds denials without lifting
any (a vendor copy from before the last clear is ignored), and the newer notice
dismissal applies. A newer local
grant is still not applied.

This changes the stored format: after a clear, the consent cookie gains
`&e=<time>` (16 bytes) and the localStorage record an `epoch` field (22 bytes).
Visitors who never cleared store what they did before. Older c15t builds reject
both the cookie and the localStorage record once they carry the epoch and treat
the visitor as undecided, so under an opt-out policy they grant optional
categories by default until a new choice is saved. Deploy the new build to every
page of the site before visitors can clear their records.

When two tabs write at the same moment and one write drops the other tab's
category or directive, the tab that lost it writes it back on its next
reconciliation, including directives it kept from storage in its own write.
Under an IAB policy, a TC string that grants a category a
reconciled denial covers is withdrawn before any `__tcfapi` listener is
notified, and one that predates another tab's newer choice is held back until
this tab reads that tab's receipt, so a revoked vendor is never advertised
again. A tab reloads the TC string when another tab stores a new receipt, which
covers a save in the same millisecond or one that changed only vendors, and
stops publishing the held one until the reload decides. Two receipts from the
same millisecond settle on the more restrictive one, so a revoked vendor is
never advertised again; when each grants something the other denies, the
stored receipt is removed and neither is published until the next save. When
another tab removes the receipt or clears localStorage, the held TC string is
withdrawn, and a receipt still being decoded is not installed. localStorage
has no conditional removal, so the removal after a tie can still delete a
receipt another tab stored a moment earlier; every tab then withholds its TC
string until the next save.

A page seeded from a server's cookie read applies newer denials and privacy
directives that reached only localStorage, and a local denial from the same
millisecond as a seeded grant, and a clear after the clock went
back more than an hour writes an epoch other tabs can still read. That capped
epoch cannot void decisions dated after it that a runtime which missed the
clear writes back; times alone cannot order a clear against a clock that went
back more than an hour. When the cookie and its localStorage copy hold
conflicting decisions from the same millisecond, the denial wins. The
subject comes from the cookie, which a server-side restoration or a sibling
subdomain can rewrite on its own, unless this browser's last write reached
only localStorage and the cookie has not changed since; such a write leaves a
`<storageKey>-cookie-miss` marker in localStorage. A localStorage write that
fails while the cookie write lands removes the older local copy.

New API:

- `runtime.reconcileStorage()` and `persistence.reconcile()` read stored
  records on demand and return whether anything changed. React's
  `usePersistence()` handle has `reconcile()` too.
- `persistence: { sync: false }` keeps storage but turns off the automatic
  reads. `dispose()` removes the listeners.

See [keep open tabs in step](https://c15t.com/docs/guides/consent-state#keep-open-tabs-in-step).

### Accept `networkBlocker` in the Vue plugin, Nuxt module and Astro integration

The plain Vue plugin started the network blocker when its options carried `networkBlocker`, but `C15tVuePluginOptions` did not include the option, so passing it was a type error. The plugin's options type now covers everything it starts on mount: `networkBlocker`, `iframeBlocker`, `scripts`, `storageConfig` and `nonce`. `RuntimeConsentConfig` and `UseNetworkBlockerOptions` are exported from `@c15t/vue/vue-plugin`.

The Nuxt module accepts `networkBlocker` in `nuxt.config.ts` under `c15t`, without `onRequestBlocked`, because module options reach the browser as JSON.

The Astro integration ignored network blocking entirely. It now takes `networkBlocker` in the integration options, and in the client extension when you need `onRequestBlocked`.

### Remove `skipPrefetch` from `resolveConsentContext`

`resolveConsentContext` no longer accepts `skipPrefetch`. Pass
`prerendered: true` for a render shared by every visitor. It ignores the
request, leaves visitor state out of the inlined config and still resolves
offline policies at build time.

### Stop Astro dialog islands shipping a second stylesheet

The dialog islands import `@c15t/ui` class maps, which import their component
CSS in the browser. Astro links every stylesheet a page script can reach, so
with `ui: 'svelte'` every page loaded about 72 KB of dialog CSS on top of the
injected stylesheet that already contains it. With `styles` on, the
integration now resolves those class maps to their variant without CSS. With
`styles: false` the islands keep their own CSS.

### Share script lifecycle with external consent providers

Add an external consent source to the framework-independent runtime, React, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit, browser, and Astro entrypoints. Next.js and TanStack Start inherit the controls through React options. Provider decisions update effective gates without creating c15t receipts or mounting a second persistence layer. Route preference controls to the external provider through a shared kernel event, report errors through lifecycle callbacks, and reload the page when the source withdraws a granted category, using the existing `reloadOnConsentRevoked` option and `onBeforeConsentRevocationReload` callback. Keep React script modules lazy through a lightweight controls entrypoint.

Add consent-aware custom event and SPA pageview dispatch to the script SDK, preserve Google tag configuration, support custom GTM data layers and Segment load options, and declare the script SDK's core runtime dependency for isolated package installations.

Keep disabled runtimes permissive when an external source is configured. Complete browser readiness after connecting the source, keep Astro preference triggers available, and reject IAB saves owned by an external CMP. External permissions disable c15t IAB authority. Deliver events for built-in Umami, Rybbit and Matomo integrations, and preserve custom GTM queue names during initialization and dispatch.

Report external CMP subscription failures without aborting provider startup. Keep optional permissions denied and ignore notifications from the failed connection.

### Show the Astro banner on prerendered pages

`ConsentBanner` rendered nothing on a prerendered page, because the build had
no policy, and the browser could only show or hide a banner that was already in
the HTML.

- In `offline()` mode the build now resolves the policy and renders the banner
  hidden. The browser shows it to visitors who have not chosen yet.
- In `hosted()` and `manifest()` mode, `ConsentBanner` leaves a placeholder.
  The browser renders the banner there, with the same markup as the server
  version, once its init returns a policy that needs one. Returning visitors
  do not download the renderer.
- A banner hidden after a choice no longer stays on screen: the stylesheet
  now makes the `hidden` attribute beat the banner's own `display`.
- The CLI's Astro boilerplate no longer tells you to avoid prerendering.

### Render theme CSS on the server

**Breaking.** The browser no longer generates theme CSS. `ConsentProvider` (and `ConsentRoot`) used to turn `options.theme` tokens into a `<style id="c15t-theme">` element on every page, so every visitor downloaded the theme generator and the default theme, about 1.7 KB gzip. The package stylesheet already carries the default tokens, so the provider now renders no theme style at all.

Render custom tokens with the new `ConsentTheme` component, exported from `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`, `@c15t/tanstack-start` and the `c15t/react`, `c15t/next` and `c15t/tanstack-start` entries. It is not a client component: render it from a Server Component and the generator stays on the server. `ConsentTheme` takes `theme`, `colorScheme` (`'light'`, `'dark'` or `'system'`, applied before hydration) and `nonce`. `generateThemeCSS()` from `@c15t/ui/theme` now escapes `<`, so its output is safe inside a `<style>` element wherever you render it.

`@c15t/svelte`'s provider no longer injects the token CSS after hydration, which also removes the one-frame flash of default colors in SvelteKit. `@c15t/astro` now renders the integration's `theme` tokens on the server, next to the config script, instead of leaving them to the dialog islands.

### Migration

- **Next.js App Router.** Move the theme to a module without `'use client'`. Render `<ConsentTheme theme={theme} />` in the root layout (a Server Component) next to your consent wrapper, and pass `colorScheme` and `nonce` there if you set them on `ConsentRoot`. Keep `options.theme` on `ConsentRoot` only for `consentActions` and slot styles.
- **Next.js Pages Router.** Render `ConsentTheme` in `pages/_document.tsx`.
- **TanStack Start.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from a `createServerFn` handler in the root loader and render it in a `<style id="c15t-theme">` in the head. Rendering `ConsentTheme` in the root component also works but ships the generator.
- **React without server rendering.** Render `ConsentTheme` next to the provider (this ships the generator), or put the output of `generateThemeCSS(theme)` in your stylesheet.
- **SvelteKit.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from `+layout.server.ts` and render it inside `<svelte:head>`. Keep slot styles and `consentActions` in `options.theme`.
- **Astro.** Keep tokens in the integration's `theme`. Tokens in the client entrypoint's `theme` are no longer applied.
- **Light and dark at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` without `colorScheme` and toggle the `dark` class on `<html>` (for example with next-themes): its output holds both schemes. The provider's `colorScheme` option still keeps the `c15t-dark` class in sync after hydration.
- **Switching token sets at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` from a client component and change its props.
- Keep importing the package stylesheet. It holds the default tokens the provider used to inject.

In development, the provider warns when `theme` holds tokens but the page has no `c15t-theme` stylesheet.

### Keep dialog CSS out of the render-blocking stylesheet

**Breaking.** `styles.css` now carries only what a first paint can show: the default tokens, every c15t CSS variable, and the rules for the banner, `ConsentDialogTrigger` and the `ConsentGate` placeholder. It shrinks from 125 KB to 66 KB (16.2 KB to 8.8 KB gzipped). The dialog and preference-widget rules moved to `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`, which the dialog's module imports, so your bundler ships them with the dialog's lazy chunk and applies them before the dialog renders. In a Next.js production build the page's stylesheet drops from 18.2 KB to 10.6 KB gzipped.

- `@c15t/ui/styles.css` and `styles.tw3.css` no longer contain the dialog, preference widget, accordion, switch, tabs, collapsible, preference item or vendor list rules. React, Next.js and TanStack Start load them for you. If you render `@c15t/ui` class maps for those parts in your own components, import `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`.
- `@c15t/react/primitives` and every `@c15t/react/primitives/*` entry load the dialog stylesheet, because the accordion, collapsible, preference item, switch and tabs rules moved there.
- JavaScript loads the dialog rules through the new `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog` module. Bundlers follow its import of `styles/dialog.css`; under the `node` export condition it imports nothing, so plain Node (the Pages Router, or SSR that keeps dependencies external) can load every `@c15t/react` entry. Import it instead of the `.css` file from components that can run on the server.
- The rules for the `@c15t/ui/styles/primitives` class maps moved to `@c15t/ui/styles/primitives.css`. The React components never used them. `c15t/svelte/styles.css` imports them; other hosts that render those class maps import the file themselves.
- `iab/styles.css` no longer repeats the default tokens and the shared rules. Import it after `styles.css`, as the IAB guides already say.
- Tailwind 3: the dialog stylesheet goes through your PostCSS pipeline, and Tailwind 3 rejects its `@layer components` block. Add `@c15t/ui/postcss-tailwind3` before `tailwindcss` in your PostCSS plugins. Without it the build fails with "`@layer components` is used but no matching `@tailwind components` directive is present".
- If you import `styles.css` into a named layer (`@import '…/styles.css' layer(c15t)`), the dialog rules still join the top-level `components` layer.

Svelte, Astro, Vue and the script-tag build render the same styles as before. `c15t/svelte/styles.css` still holds every rule, because Svelte loads its dialog with the page. Astro injects the banner rules; the React and Svelte dialog islands import the rest, which Astro links on every page, and with `ui: 'vue'` the integration injects them. If you set `styles: false` with `ui: 'vue'`, also import `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`. `@c15t/browser` inlines the dialog rules as before.

### Ship Astro consent styles automatically

The quickstart said the integration supplies styles, but it did not. On the
server, the components read class names through the `node` export condition,
which imports no CSS, so the banner and dialog rendered unstyled unless you
imported the stylesheet yourself.

The integration now adds `@c15t/astro/styles.css` to every page, plus the new
`@c15t/astro/iab/styles.css` when `iab` is set. Remove your own import of the
stylesheet. Set `styles: false` to keep loading it yourself, for example from
a global stylesheet that orders its own cascade layers.

The CLI's Astro boilerplate no longer imports the stylesheet.

### Show the Astro IAB banner on prerendered hosted and manifest pages

`IABConsentBanner` rendered nothing on a prerendered page in `hosted()` or
`manifest()` mode, or whenever the server had no vendor list yet. It now leaves
a placeholder, and the browser renders the IAB banner there with the same
markup as the server version once the policy and vendor list arrive. Under an
IAB policy the browser picks the IAB banner over a `ConsentBanner` placeholder
on the same page.

### Reload the page when a visitor revokes consent

Revoking consent removed a vendor's script element but left its code running. Listeners, timers, history hooks and chat widgets kept working until the next full page load. v2 reloaded the page on revocation, and v3 lost that behaviour when the consent policy contracts were unified.

When an accept, reject or save turns off a category or vendor that was granted, the page now reloads after every in-flight save request settles, so the next page runs only permitted code. `onBeforeConsentRevocationReload` runs just before the reload. A first visit that rejects under opt-in does not reload, because nothing gated had run. Rejecting defaults under opt-out does, because gated code ran before the choice. Expiry, policy changes and privacy signals do not reload.

Set `reloadOnConsentRevoked: false` to turn this off. The option is available on `ConsentProvider`, `ConsentRoot` `options`, `createConsentRuntime()`, the Vue plugin config, the browser client, and the Astro integration. `@c15t/svelte` receives it through its runtime options.

### Keep offline mode out of the Astro page script for hosted and manifest sites

The page script the integration injects picks its transport at runtime, and it
imported the offline transport statically. Every hosted and manifest site
therefore shipped offline mode and its recommended policy-rule pack in the
script that runs on every page, where they never run: about 10 KB gzipped.
Offline mode now loads in its own chunk on the first browser init. An offline
page the server already resolved never inits, so it doesn't load the chunk
either.

### Astro server renders no longer wait on a slow or unreachable consent backend

The Astro middleware resolves consent before the page renders. In hosted mode it
called the backend's `/init` with no time limit, so a backend that never
answered held every server-rendered page open. In manifest mode a cold cache
waited for the manifest request's 10 second timeout. The middleware now waits at
most 500 ms. When that runs out the page renders without the server decision:
no banner in the HTML, optional categories denied, and consent-gated scripts and
iframes blocked. The browser then resolves the policy and shows the banner. A
manifest request keeps running, fills the cache for the next render, and is
handed to the adapter's `waitUntil` when there is one.

Set the budget with `middleware: { timeoutMs }` in the integration options, or
`timeoutMs` when calling `resolveConsentContext` yourself. `timeoutMs: false`
waits for the backend as before. `DEFAULT_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS` is exported from
`@c15t/astro/server`.

### Migration

Sites whose backend takes longer than 500 ms to answer `/init` now get the
banner after the page loads instead of in the server HTML. Raise
`middleware.timeoutMs` above the backend's usual response time, or set it to
`false` to keep the old behavior.

### Start loading the Astro preference dialog on hover and focus

The preference dialog is an island that downloads the first time it opens, so
the first Customize click waited for the framework runtime and the dialog to
download. Pointing at or focusing a control that opens the preference dialog
now starts that download. With a mouse the dialog is usually there by the time
the click lands. Visitors who only accept or reject still download nothing,
and a failed download is retried on the next hover, focus or open.

### Add `c15t/astro` to the `c15t` package

Astro sites can install `c15t` and import `c15t/astro`, like `c15t/react`
and the other framework entry points. The named components are at
`c15t/astro/components/<name>.astro`, and the stylesheets at
`c15t/astro/styles.css` and `c15t/astro/iab/styles.css`.

To support it, `@c15t/astro`:

- exports `./components/consent-script.astro` by name, like its other
  components;
- resolves the entry points it hands to Astro (middleware, routes, the page
  script, the dialog islands and the stylesheets) to file paths, so a site
  installed with pnpm that only lists `c15t` still builds;
- keeps its stylesheet in one file, so the copy `c15t` ships stays
  self-contained.
- marks its `astro` peer optional, so installing `c15t` for React, Next.js,
  Vue or plain JavaScript does not pull in Astro.

### Show the offline Astro banner at first paint on prerendered pages

A prerendered banner ships hidden, because the same HTML serves visitors who
have already chosen. It used to stay hidden until the page's module scripts
loaded. An inline script after the banner now shows it straight away when the
visitor has nothing stored under any consent key, including a stored privacy directive. Blocked `localStorage` counts as nothing stored there. Visitors with a stored
record still wait for the runtime, which validates it. The new
`buildBannerRevealScript` helper is exported from `@c15t/astro/server`.

## @c15t/astro@3.0.0-alpha.2 (alpha)

### Fix declaration imports for Node16 and NodeNext

Fix declaration imports for TypeScript consumers using Node16 or NodeNext resolution. Preserve explicit JavaScript filenames so exported APIs retain their types without requiring `skipLibCheck`.

### Session reports from manifest mode

A host that resolves init from a cached manifest never calls `/init`, so the backend could not count the visitors it served. Every server-side resolution now sends `POST /sessions` to the backend after the fact, server-to-server and detached from the response: the Next.js, TanStack Start, SvelteKit, Nuxt and Astro init routes, and the Next.js, TanStack Start and Astro render-time prefetches. The report carries the manifest revision, the matched policy, the jurisdiction, country, region, language and GPC signal. The visitor's user agent travels as `User-Agent` and the visitor's single client address on a dedicated `X-C15T-Client-IP` header, which the backend masks and records under its `ipAddress` settings; the forwarding chain itself is not sent, and neither are cookies. The browser makes no request.

`@c15t/backend` adds the `POST /sessions` route and a `sessions.onReport` option. Reports are written to the request's wide event and handed to the sink; nothing is stored. The backend's own `/init` emits the same event, so one sink sees hosted and manifest traffic alike.

Reports are handed to the same `onBackgroundRevalidate` hook as a background manifest refresh, so a host that already passes `after` or a platform `waitUntil` needs no change. `resolveConsent` in `@c15t/nextjs/server` gains `waitUntil` for the App Router. Set `reportSessions: false` on any adapter to send none. `createManifestTransport` in `@c15t/core` gains a `report` option; `@c15t/schema` adds `consentSessionReportSchema` and `buildConsentSessionReport`.

### Remove dialog scheduling delays and preserve IAB actions

Remove first-open scheduling delays from React's aggregate dialog, widget, and compound components while preserving server rendering and hydration. Keep children mounted when an external runtime provides IAB context, so loading the bridge cannot reset local drafts.

Remove the extra Suspense delay from Astro's React IAB dialog island.

Queue external-runtime IAB actions until the runtime publishes its handle, and reject pending saves with AbortError when the borrowing provider unmounts. Correct the React and Next.js peer dependency ranges to require React and React DOM 18 or newer, matching the APIs already used by v3. Upgrade both React packages before using v3 on an older installation.

# @c15t/astro

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- dd44a61: Add opt-in `clearOnRevocation` configuration to remove declared cookies, localStorage keys, and sessionStorage keys when their consent category is denied or revoked. Support exact names, prefix patterns, and cookie scopes while protecting c15t consent records.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [dd44a61]
- Updated dependencies [46f45c4]
  - @c15t/core@3.0.0-alpha.1

  - @c15t/ui@3.0.0-alpha.1
  - @c15t/iab@3.0.0-alpha.1

## 3.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- 4460e3e: This v3 alpha is for internal use only. APIs are unstable, and breaking changes will occur between alpha releases.

  Introduce the c15t umbrella package, shared consent runtime and policy rules, rewritten backend, and new framework and script-tag integrations. Update the CLI, IAB support, DevTools, and shared styles for v3.

  Packages now ship ESM only. Keep related packages on compatible v3 alpha versions.

  Export `defineTheme` and the `Theme` type from the React, Next.js, TanStack Start, and Vue entries so themes can use the same imports as their framework integration.

  Restrict iframe-blocker URL activation to HTTP and HTTPS. Replace backtracking URL and theme parsing expressions, correct the PostHog hostname boundary, and fix CLI layout detection for nested route groups and locale directories.

  Serve a stale consent manifest from the server adapters' in-process cache inside the backend's `stale-while-revalidate` window while one background request revalidates it, instead of blocking every request after `s-maxage` expires; a failed or timed-out revalidation keeps the stale manifest. The backend sends its manifest cache policy as `CDN-Cache-Control` too, so Vercel's CDN forwards it. Add `onBackgroundRevalidate` to the core cache and every server adapter for runtimes that stop detached work after the response.
