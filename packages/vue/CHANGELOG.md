### Mount collapsed preference content on first open

**Breaking.** A collapsed row in the preferences dialog or `ConsentWidget` no longer renders its content until it first opens. This applies to category rows, vendor cards and IAB purpose, stack and vendor rows. The content element is still rendered, empty, so the trigger's `aria-controls` target exists. Its children mount the first time the row opens and then stay mounted, so the close transition keeps its content. Collapsed content was already `inert` and `aria-hidden`, so keyboard and screen-reader behavior does not change.

Opening the dialog used to mount every vendor card inside the collapsed categories. With 100 declared vendors that was 1,625 React components and 1,811 DOM nodes. It is now 112 components and 103 nodes, the same as with no vendors, and the React commit at 4× CPU slowdown drops from 36 ms to 13 ms.

### Migration

- Tests that read a category description, vendor card or vendor details before opening its row: open the row first. `consent-widget-accordion-content-*` and `consent-widget-vendor-content-*` still exist while collapsed, but they are empty.
- Custom compositions of the `PreferenceItem` primitive that need collapsed children in the DOM, for example because custom CSS shows them: pass the new `forceMount` prop to the content part (`PreferenceItem.Content` in React and Svelte, `PreferenceItemContent` in Vue).

### Encode and enforce IAB publisher restrictions

Configure TCF publisher restrictions with `publisherRestrictions` on `createIAB`, `IABProvider`, the runtime's `iab` options or the Astro integration's `iab` options. c15t writes them into the TC string's `PubRestrictions` section, decodes them from stored strings, and reports them through `__tcfapi('getTCData')` as `publisher.restrictions`. Previously that map was always empty and configured restrictions were not encoded.

Consent-gated scripts, network rules and iframes with a `vendorId` now apply the confirmed restrictions: type 0 blocks the purpose, type 1 requires consent and type 2 requires legitimate interest for purposes the vendor list marks as flexible. Accept all grants the vendor signal a restriction needs. Legitimate interest a restriction introduces applies until the visitor objects, so Save Settings encodes it as allowed, matching what the preference centres show.

The React, Vue, Svelte and `@c15t/browser/iab` preference centres list each vendor under the legal basis the restrictions leave it, so a vendor moved to legitimate interest gets an objection control instead of a consent toggle. A purpose whose vendors all use legitimate interest shows no consent switch, only the objection, and display-model rows report this as `hasConsentBasis`. Such a purpose no longer decides its c15t category, so a granular save no longer records a denial that blocks its legitimate-interest vendors; legitimate interest never grants a category on its own. Custom UIs can use `applyPublisherRestrictionsToGVL` from `@c15t/iab/headless` or pass `publisherRestrictions` to `processGVLForDialog`.

IAB gates no longer let a refused c15t category block a target that uses only legitimate interest after publisher restrictions. Such a target needs no consent under TCF, so its purpose and vendor legitimate interest signals, and the visitor's objection, decide. Previously every restriction on a referenced category blocked IAB targets; GPC, opt-out directives and strict scope still do, and the refused category still blocks scripts that name only the category or declare a consent purpose.

Unsupported restrictions throw `PublisherRestrictionError` instead of being dropped. This covers reserved type 3, vendors or purposes missing from the vendor list, legitimate interest for purposes 1 and 3 to 6, basis changes on purposes the vendor does not declare as flexible, conflicting types for one vendor, and restrictions in a string that is not service-specific. `whenReady()`, `save()` and `generateTCString()` reject, and no TC string is written. Retrying `whenReady()` does not fetch another vendor list. With an explicit `gvl`, the error lasts for the handle and saving keeps failing even if the kernel later holds a different list; a CMP following the kernel's list checks a replacement list again. When a replacement vendor list makes a restriction unsupported, the TC authority confirmed under the previous list is cleared. Whenever the CMP withdraws its own authority, including on expiry, it also removes the `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry. A stored TC string whose restrictions differ from the configuration is not restored; the banner opens again for a returning visitor and closes once they save, IAB gates stay denied until then, and the superseded `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry are removed. Decoding a string written under TCF policy version 2 or 3 accepts legitimate interest required for purposes 3 to 6, which those versions allowed.

### Keep open tabs in step with stored consent

A choice saved in one tab now reaches the other open tabs on the same origin
without a reload. Before, a tab kept a grant after another tab stored a denial,
and neither `kernel.refresh()` nor `runtime.reinit()` read storage again.

Browser persistence reads stored records again when another tab on the same
origin changes a c15t localStorage key, when the page becomes visible and when
the window regains focus. A tab on another subdomain that shares the consent
cookie gets no `storage` event and catches up on its next focus or visibility
change, and so does every tab when localStorage is unavailable and only the
cookie is stored. Category decisions merge per category, keeping the newer decision for
each, and privacy directives merge as a union. A stored notice or vendor record
replaces the one in memory unless it is older. A record removed from storage is
cleared, so the active policy decides again. Blocked storage or bytes that do
not decode change nothing. Reconnecting does not read storage.

Queued writes follow the same rules. A tab lands its own pending write before it
reads, a choice write stores the per-category merge with what storage holds, a
directive write keeps every stored directive, and the rewrite that adds a
server subject id no longer recreates records another tab cleared. When two
tabs act in the same millisecond, the record stored first wins in both. A
tab that opened before another stored a subject joins the stored subject
unless it identified a different user; a subject id the server resolved is
kept unless a strictly newer stored choice carries another one. Only a
record this tab saw in storage is cleared when it disappears, so a choice
seeded while storage was blocked survives storage becoming readable.

Under an IAB policy, `@c15t/iab` loads the TC string another tab stored once
its choice is reconciled, with its purpose, vendor and special-feature
selections, so `__tcfapi` and the preference controls no longer show the
previous choice. Selections changed in this tab without saving are kept. A
TC string that grants any purpose of a category denied after it was saved
is withdrawn and not restored on the next page load; a partial purpose
selection saved through IAB keeps its TC string. A TC string confirmed before
the reconciled choice's newest decision, such as after a save on a sibling
subdomain that shares the consent cookie, is withdrawn as well, since the TC
string and its receipt belong to one origin. A newer receipt replaces the held
one even when the TC string is identical.

Clearing records now stores the clear epoch, the time of the clear, under
`c15t-epoch` in localStorage and a cookie of the same name, and clearing never
removes it. Every consent record written afterwards records its epoch too.
Decisions confirmed before the epoch are void everywhere: a tab that reconciles
after another tab cleared and saved again drops its pre-clear decisions, a tab
that missed the clear cannot write them back, and browser hydration and server
reads (`readStoredRecordsFromCookieHeader`) ignore them. A decision in the
clearing millisecond counts only from a tab that had seen the clear. Each clear
moves the epoch forward even after the clock went back, and an epoch up to an
hour ahead of the clock is kept. Records from before any clear, including v2
and legacy records, read as epoch 0 and are unaffected; a corrupt epoch also
reads as 0, and a record whose epoch field is corrupt is kept.

The consent cookie stays authoritative, but a denial in its localStorage copy
that is newer than the cookie's decision is now applied on top of it, so a
dropped cookie write no longer keeps an older grant in force. Copies written
under different clear epochs are cut to the later epoch first, and the
subject comes from the later copy. Privacy directives from both copies of the
privacy record apply, a newer local vendor list adds denials without lifting
any (a vendor copy from before the last clear is ignored), and the newer notice
dismissal applies. A newer local
grant is still not applied.

This changes the stored format: after a clear, the consent cookie gains
`&e=<time>` (16 bytes) and the localStorage record an `epoch` field (22 bytes).
Visitors who never cleared store what they did before. Older c15t builds reject
both the cookie and the localStorage record once they carry the epoch and treat
the visitor as undecided, so under an opt-out policy they grant optional
categories by default until a new choice is saved. Deploy the new build to every
page of the site before visitors can clear their records.

When two tabs write at the same moment and one write drops the other tab's
category or directive, the tab that lost it writes it back on its next
reconciliation, including directives it kept from storage in its own write.
Under an IAB policy, a TC string that grants a category a
reconciled denial covers is withdrawn before any `__tcfapi` listener is
notified, and one that predates another tab's newer choice is held back until
this tab reads that tab's receipt, so a revoked vendor is never advertised
again. A tab reloads the TC string when another tab stores a new receipt, which
covers a save in the same millisecond or one that changed only vendors, and
stops publishing the held one until the reload decides. Two receipts from the
same millisecond settle on the more restrictive one, so a revoked vendor is
never advertised again; when each grants something the other denies, the
stored receipt is removed and neither is published until the next save. When
another tab removes the receipt or clears localStorage, the held TC string is
withdrawn, and a receipt still being decoded is not installed. localStorage
has no conditional removal, so the removal after a tie can still delete a
receipt another tab stored a moment earlier; every tab then withholds its TC
string until the next save.

A page seeded from a server's cookie read applies newer denials and privacy
directives that reached only localStorage, and a local denial from the same
millisecond as a seeded grant, and a clear after the clock went
back more than an hour writes an epoch other tabs can still read. That capped
epoch cannot void decisions dated after it that a runtime which missed the
clear writes back; times alone cannot order a clear against a clock that went
back more than an hour. When the cookie and its localStorage copy hold
conflicting decisions from the same millisecond, the denial wins. The
subject comes from the cookie, which a server-side restoration or a sibling
subdomain can rewrite on its own, unless this browser's last write reached
only localStorage and the cookie has not changed since; such a write leaves a
`<storageKey>-cookie-miss` marker in localStorage. A localStorage write that
fails while the cookie write lands removes the older local copy.

New API:

- `runtime.reconcileStorage()` and `persistence.reconcile()` read stored
  records on demand and return whether anything changed. React's
  `usePersistence()` handle has `reconcile()` too.
- `persistence: { sync: false }` keeps storage but turns off the automatic
  reads. `dispose()` removes the listeners.

See [keep open tabs in step](https://c15t.com/docs/guides/consent-state#keep-open-tabs-in-step).

### Accept `networkBlocker` in the Vue plugin, Nuxt module and Astro integration

The plain Vue plugin started the network blocker when its options carried `networkBlocker`, but `C15tVuePluginOptions` did not include the option, so passing it was a type error. The plugin's options type now covers everything it starts on mount: `networkBlocker`, `iframeBlocker`, `scripts`, `storageConfig` and `nonce`. `RuntimeConsentConfig` and `UseNetworkBlockerOptions` are exported from `@c15t/vue/vue-plugin`.

The Nuxt module accepts `networkBlocker` in `nuxt.config.ts` under `c15t`, without `onRequestBlocked`, because module options reach the browser as JSON.

The Astro integration ignored network blocking entirely. It now takes `networkBlocker` in the integration options, and in the client extension when you need `onRequestBlocked`.

### Close consent surfaces without waiting for the backend

Save, Accept all and Reject all now close the preference dialog in the same
task as the click, in React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte,
Astro's dialog islands and the browser client. The choice, storage, scripts,
iframes and network rules update from the local record first; the backend
request runs afterwards. Before, the dialog stayed open until the request
answered. In a Next.js production build with 170 ms of network latency, a 4x
CPU slowdown and a 200 ms backend, Save now closes the dialog after 18 ms
instead of 486 ms. The browser client's
banner waited the same way and now closes on the click too. IAB banners and
dialogs close on the click and come back only if the choice could not be
recorded locally, for example when the vendor list failed to load.

A failed request no longer keeps the dialog open or reopens it. The choice
stays, the failure reaches `onError` and the kernel's `command:error` event,
and the kernel replays the queued save after the next initialization or when
the browser comes back online.

Callback timing is unchanged: `onChoiceRecorded` and `onPermissionsChanged`
still run in the click task, and the promises returned by `performAction()`,
`saveConsents()` and the browser client's `save()` still settle when the
request does. Svelte's `ConsentButton` no longer leaves an unhandled rejection
when a save fails.

### Share script lifecycle with external consent providers

Add an external consent source to the framework-independent runtime, React, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit, browser, and Astro entrypoints. Next.js and TanStack Start inherit the controls through React options. Provider decisions update effective gates without creating c15t receipts or mounting a second persistence layer. Route preference controls to the external provider through a shared kernel event, report errors through lifecycle callbacks, and reload the page when the source withdraws a granted category, using the existing `reloadOnConsentRevoked` option and `onBeforeConsentRevocationReload` callback. Keep React script modules lazy through a lightweight controls entrypoint.

Add consent-aware custom event and SPA pageview dispatch to the script SDK, preserve Google tag configuration, support custom GTM data layers and Segment load options, and declare the script SDK's core runtime dependency for isolated package installations.

Keep disabled runtimes permissive when an external source is configured. Complete browser readiness after connecting the source, keep Astro preference triggers available, and reject IAB saves owned by an external CMP. External permissions disable c15t IAB authority. Deliver events for built-in Umami, Rybbit and Matomo integrations, and preserve custom GTM queue names during initialization and dispatch.

Report external CMP subscription failures without aborting provider startup. Keep optional permissions denied and ignore notifications from the failed connection.

### `useNetworkBlocker` holds matching requests from its first render

The standalone `useNetworkBlocker` hook installed the blocker from a mount effect. Effects in the calling component's children, and in components rendered before it, run first, so matching `fetch` and XHR requests sent from them went out without a consent check on first visits and for visitors who had rejected. The hook now holds matching requests from the first render of the component that calls it, the same way the provider's `networkBlocker` option does since the previous release, and the blocker decides them once it loads.

Holds are now tracked per caller. When a page uses both the provider option and the hook, one blocker loading or one component unmounting no longer releases requests that the other's rules still hold. A blocker configured with `enabled: false` holds nothing and no longer sends requests another caller holds. `createConsentRuntime()` (which the Svelte, Astro and browser packages use) and the Vue plugin follow the same rules, and a runtime or Vue context disposed before it starts ends only its own hold. The requests it held are answered as blocked (a 451 response for `fetch`, a failed XHR) rather than sent, since nothing checked consent for them.

### Migration

The hook's first render in the browser now has a side effect: it patches `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to hold requests that match its rules. On the server it still does nothing. If React discards that render and never commits it (a render that throws, or an attempt thrown away while suspending), the hold ends after 10 seconds and the requests it held fail as blocked (a 451 response for `fetch`, a failed XHR), since nothing checked consent for them. The same applies when the hook's component, or the provider, unmounts before its blocker loads. No code changes are needed. If a test asserts that `window.fetch` is untouched after rendering a component that calls the hook, update it: during the first render `window.fetch` is the hold's wrapper, and after the blocker loads it is the blocker's.

### Stop Nuxt pages from downloading every locale on first load

In a Nuxt 4 build, every page downloaded the all-locale translations chunk (about 57 KB gzip, 206 KB raw) in its first load, in server manifest mode, hosted mode and client manifest mode alike. Only client manifest mode uses it. The Vue runtime imported the manifest resolver and the translations with two separate `import()` calls, and Vite 8 put a helper that the app entry needs into the translations chunk, so the entry loaded that chunk statically.

The runtime now loads both through one module. Server manifest and hosted mode no longer download the translations. Client manifest mode, which resolves the manifest as the page starts, now bundles the resolver with the entry through a plugin the Nuxt module adds in that mode, so the page still preloads it. Plain Vue apps built with Vite were not affected and load the same code as before.

### Reload the page when a visitor revokes consent

Revoking consent removed a vendor's script element but left its code running. Listeners, timers, history hooks and chat widgets kept working until the next full page load. v2 reloaded the page on revocation, and v3 lost that behaviour when the consent policy contracts were unified.

When an accept, reject or save turns off a category or vendor that was granted, the page now reloads after every in-flight save request settles, so the next page runs only permitted code. `onBeforeConsentRevocationReload` runs just before the reload. A first visit that rejects under opt-in does not reload, because nothing gated had run. Rejecting defaults under opt-out does, because gated code ran before the choice. Expiry, policy changes and privacy signals do not reload.

Set `reloadOnConsentRevoked: false` to turn this off. The option is available on `ConsentProvider`, `ConsentRoot` `options`, `createConsentRuntime()`, the Vue plugin config, the browser client, and the Astro integration. `@c15t/svelte` receives it through its runtime options.

### Re-render Vue components only when their consent value changes

`useHasConsent()`, `useConsentInit()` and `useConsentPolicyActions()` returned a new array or object on every kernel update, so a component reading one re-rendered whenever anything changed, including opening the dialog. They now keep their previous value while its contents are unchanged. A component using `useHasConsent()` re-renders when a category is granted or revoked, and one using `useConsentInit()` when translations, location, branding or IAB data change. The stock banner, dialog and preference widget read these values too, and follow the same rule.

### Load the Vue dialog's stylesheet with the dialog

The stock banner's description imported the dialog's style map, and a style map brings its stylesheet with it. So every page with the banner loaded the dialog's rules up front; in Nuxt they were part of the render-blocking entry stylesheet (14.7 KB raw, 2.3 KB gzip). The banner now renders its description without the dialog's map, and the dialog's rules load with the dialog's own chunk. `ConsentDescription` keeps its props and output.

### Load each component stylesheet rule once

Apps that import `styles.css` no longer download component rules a second time. The `@c15t/ui/styles/components/<name>` class maps used to import their own CSS, so bundlers such as Next.js with Turbopack emitted extra stylesheets for the banner, actions, legal links and consent gate on first load, and for the dialog when it opened, all duplicating rules already in `styles.css`. Class maps now carry no CSS, and `styles.css` stays the single source for React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Svelte and Astro.

Vue components still include their styles: they now import the matching `@c15t/ui/styles/components/<name>.css` files directly, and Vue apps emit the same CSS as before.

If you imported `@c15t/ui/styles/components/<name>` class maps in your own components and relied on them to load CSS, import `styles.css` once, or import the matching `<name>.css` file.

### Server rendering no longer waits on a slow or failing consent backend

`resolveConsent` in Next.js and TanStack Start, and server rendering in Nuxt, now wait at most `timeoutMs` (500 ms by default) for the visitor's policy. Before, a backend that never answered held an awaited layout blank for the manifest cache's 10 second timeout. When the budget runs out, the page renders without consent UI in the server HTML, optional categories stay denied and consent-gated scripts and iframes stay blocked. The browser then resolves the policy and shows the banner once the backend answers. The manifest request keeps running and fills the cache for the next request.

The server manifest cache now remembers a failed request when nothing usable is cached. It waits 1 second before asking the backend again, doubling up to 5 seconds while failures continue; requests in between fail at once with a `ManifestUnavailableError`. Before, every request after a cold failure went to the backend. Concurrent requests still share one upstream request, and a stale copy is still served only inside the backend's `stale-while-revalidate` window. The upstream request timeout drops from 10 to 5 seconds.

Next.js `resolveConsent` reads the manifest through the in-process cache whatever `manifestURL` points at. A warm render no longer makes a request to your own manifest route, and a `manifestURL` pointing at the backend no longer fetches it on every render.

The Nuxt init route no longer falls back to the backend's `/init` for every request while the manifest is backing off. It still falls back when the backend has no `/manifest` endpoint.

### Migration

- Pages whose backend takes longer than 500 ms on a cold cache now render the banner after hydration on that request instead of in the server HTML. Raise `timeoutMs`, or set `timeoutMs: false` to wait as before, up to the new 5 second request timeout.
- Pass `waitUntil` to Next.js `resolveConsent`, or `onBackgroundRevalidate` to TanStack Start `resolveConsent`, so serverless platforms keep a manifest request alive after the render stops waiting for it.
- Code that retried the manifest cache in a loop after a failure now receives `ManifestUnavailableError` with `reason: 'backoff'` until the retry floor passes. Its `retryAfterMs` says when the next attempt is allowed.
- Next.js `resolveConsent` now refuses to forward `forwardHeaders` credentials to a plain `http://` manifest URL on a host other than loopback, matching the route handlers; the render falls back to the baseline state and reports the error.

### Block network requests sent before the network blocker loads

The network blocker loaded after mount, so a `fetch` or XHR that matched a rule and was sent from a child component's mount effect, from an effect next to the provider, or from a client module evaluated inside it went out without a consent check. This happened on first visits, for visitors who had rejected, and when the policy request failed or hung. `ConsentProvider` and `ConsentRoot` now hold matching requests from their first render in the browser, and the blocker decides them once it loads. Vue holds them from plugin install until the root mounts. `createConsentRuntime()`, which `@c15t/svelte` and the `c15t` browser client use, holds them from construction until `start()`. A provider that unmounts before its blocker loads, a runtime disposed before `start()`, or a Vue context disposed before its root mounts answers the requests it held as blocked (a 451 response for `fetch`, a failed XHR) rather than sending them, since nothing checked consent for them. Requests another caller still holds keep waiting.

While consent is unknown, a matching request that would be blocked now waits instead of failing. It is sent if the resolved policy and the visitor's stored choice allow it, and blocked if they do not or if the policy fails to load. Requests that match no rule are not delayed. Apps without `networkBlocker` still do not download the blocker; the hold adds about 0.8 KB gzip to first-load JavaScript.

Requests made before the provider renders are still out of reach, including inline scripts, tags loaded before hydration, and client modules that webpack evaluates when a route's chunk loads. The new network blocker pages for Next.js and React describe these limits and how to keep tracking calls out of that window.

## @c15t/vue@3.0.0-alpha.2 (alpha)

### Session reports from manifest mode

A host that resolves init from a cached manifest never calls `/init`, so the backend could not count the visitors it served. Every server-side resolution now sends `POST /sessions` to the backend after the fact, server-to-server and detached from the response: the Next.js, TanStack Start, SvelteKit, Nuxt and Astro init routes, and the Next.js, TanStack Start and Astro render-time prefetches. The report carries the manifest revision, the matched policy, the jurisdiction, country, region, language and GPC signal. The visitor's user agent travels as `User-Agent` and the visitor's single client address on a dedicated `X-C15T-Client-IP` header, which the backend masks and records under its `ipAddress` settings; the forwarding chain itself is not sent, and neither are cookies. The browser makes no request.

`@c15t/backend` adds the `POST /sessions` route and a `sessions.onReport` option. Reports are written to the request's wide event and handed to the sink; nothing is stored. The backend's own `/init` emits the same event, so one sink sees hosted and manifest traffic alike.

Reports are handed to the same `onBackgroundRevalidate` hook as a background manifest refresh, so a host that already passes `after` or a platform `waitUntil` needs no change. `resolveConsent` in `@c15t/nextjs/server` gains `waitUntil` for the App Router. Set `reportSessions: false` on any adapter to send none. `createManifestTransport` in `@c15t/core` gains a `report` option; `@c15t/schema` adds `consentSessionReportSchema` and `buildConsentSessionReport`.

### Rename `Frame` to `ConsentGate`

`Frame` is now `ConsentGate` in React, Next.js, TanStack Start and Svelte, and Vue's `ConsentFrame` is now `ConsentGate`. The compound parts follow: `ConsentGate.Root`, `ConsentGate.Title` and `ConsentGate.Button`, with `ConsentGateProps` and `ConsentGateCompoundComponent` types. New subpaths are `c15t/react/consent-gate`, `c15t/react/components/consent-gate` and `@c15t/vue/runtime/components/consent-gate.vue`, and Nuxt auto-registers `<ConsentGate>`.

The old names, subpaths and Nuxt component remain as deprecated aliases for the same component. Props, behavior, `frame.*` translation keys, `--frame-*` CSS custom properties and `data-testid="frame-placeholder"` are unchanged.

### Granular consent

Grant a category and still turn one vendor off, outside IAB TCF. Declare vendors with the `vendors` option or the backend manifest, then name them with `vendor` on scripts and network rules and `data-vendor` on iframes. A target loads when its category passes and its vendor is not off; `alwaysLoad` scripts see the result in their callbacks.

The preference centers in React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue, Nuxt and Svelte list each category's vendors with a switch per vendor. Switches edit the draft and record on Save, disable while the category is off, and clear on Accept all and Reject all. React adds `useVendorDraft`, `useVendorAllowed`, `useDeclaredVendors` and `useVendorChoice`; `useConsentDraft` gains `vendors` and `setVendor`; the Svelte manager state gains `selectedVendors` and `setSelectedVendor`.

Denials persist in a `<storageKey>-vendors` cookie and localStorage entry and reach the backend as `vendorChoice`. Migration `4-vendor-choice` adds the column, so run the migrator before deploying. A denial has no expiry and does not delete cookies the vendor already set.

Also fixed: the Vue preference center rendered its switches and category rows unstyled in Nuxt, and the Vue and Svelte category description colour differed from React's.

### Restore category discovery and consent completion

Restore category discovery from scripts, frames, and network rules. Merge discovered categories with `consentCategories` within the policy scope, and use the same set for the dialog and consent completion. Keep the banner dismissed after accepting the displayed categories and reloading. Enable tagged iframe discovery and blocking by default in React, matching the shared runtime.

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- dd44a61: Add opt-in `clearOnRevocation` configuration to remove declared cookies, localStorage keys, and sessionStorage keys when their consent category is denied or revoked. Support exact names, prefix patterns, and cookie scopes while protecting c15t consent records.

## 3.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- 4460e3e: This v3 alpha is for internal use only. APIs are unstable, and breaking changes will occur between alpha releases.

  Introduce the c15t umbrella package, shared consent runtime and policy rules, rewritten backend, and new framework and script-tag integrations. Update the CLI, IAB support, DevTools, and shared styles for v3.

  Packages now ship ESM only. Keep related packages on compatible v3 alpha versions.

  Export `defineTheme` and the `Theme` type from the React, Next.js, TanStack Start, and Vue entries so themes can use the same imports as their framework integration.

  Restrict iframe-blocker URL activation to HTTP and HTTPS. Replace backtracking URL and theme parsing expressions, correct the PostHog hostname boundary, and fix CLI layout detection for nested route groups and locale directories.

  Serve a stale consent manifest from the server adapters' in-process cache inside the backend's `stale-while-revalidate` window while one background request revalidates it, instead of blocking every request after `s-maxage` expires; a failed or timed-out revalidation keeps the stale manifest. The backend sends its manifest cache policy as `CDN-Cache-Control` too, so Vercel's CDN forwards it. Add `onBackgroundRevalidate` to the core cache and every server adapter for runtimes that stop detached work after the response.
