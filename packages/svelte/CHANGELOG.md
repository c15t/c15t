### Mount collapsed preference content on first open

**Breaking.** A collapsed row in the preferences dialog or `ConsentWidget` no longer renders its content until it first opens. This applies to category rows, vendor cards and IAB purpose, stack and vendor rows. The content element is still rendered, empty, so the trigger's `aria-controls` target exists. Its children mount the first time the row opens and then stay mounted, so the close transition keeps its content. Collapsed content was already `inert` and `aria-hidden`, so keyboard and screen-reader behavior does not change.

Opening the dialog used to mount every vendor card inside the collapsed categories. With 100 declared vendors that was 1,625 React components and 1,811 DOM nodes. It is now 112 components and 103 nodes, the same as with no vendors, and the React commit at 4× CPU slowdown drops from 36 ms to 13 ms.

### Migration

- Tests that read a category description, vendor card or vendor details before opening its row: open the row first. `consent-widget-accordion-content-*` and `consent-widget-vendor-content-*` still exist while collapsed, but they are empty.
- Custom compositions of the `PreferenceItem` primitive that need collapsed children in the DOM, for example because custom CSS shows them: pass the new `forceMount` prop to the content part (`PreferenceItem.Content` in React and Svelte, `PreferenceItemContent` in Vue).

### Encode and enforce IAB publisher restrictions

Configure TCF publisher restrictions with `publisherRestrictions` on `createIAB`, `IABProvider`, the runtime's `iab` options or the Astro integration's `iab` options. c15t writes them into the TC string's `PubRestrictions` section, decodes them from stored strings, and reports them through `__tcfapi('getTCData')` as `publisher.restrictions`. Previously that map was always empty and configured restrictions were not encoded.

Consent-gated scripts, network rules and iframes with a `vendorId` now apply the confirmed restrictions: type 0 blocks the purpose, type 1 requires consent and type 2 requires legitimate interest for purposes the vendor list marks as flexible. Accept all grants the vendor signal a restriction needs. Legitimate interest a restriction introduces applies until the visitor objects, so Save Settings encodes it as allowed, matching what the preference centres show.

The React, Vue, Svelte and `@c15t/browser/iab` preference centres list each vendor under the legal basis the restrictions leave it, so a vendor moved to legitimate interest gets an objection control instead of a consent toggle. A purpose whose vendors all use legitimate interest shows no consent switch, only the objection, and display-model rows report this as `hasConsentBasis`. Such a purpose no longer decides its c15t category, so a granular save no longer records a denial that blocks its legitimate-interest vendors; legitimate interest never grants a category on its own. Custom UIs can use `applyPublisherRestrictionsToGVL` from `@c15t/iab/headless` or pass `publisherRestrictions` to `processGVLForDialog`.

IAB gates no longer let a refused c15t category block a target that uses only legitimate interest after publisher restrictions. Such a target needs no consent under TCF, so its purpose and vendor legitimate interest signals, and the visitor's objection, decide. Previously every restriction on a referenced category blocked IAB targets; GPC, opt-out directives and strict scope still do, and the refused category still blocks scripts that name only the category or declare a consent purpose.

Unsupported restrictions throw `PublisherRestrictionError` instead of being dropped. This covers reserved type 3, vendors or purposes missing from the vendor list, legitimate interest for purposes 1 and 3 to 6, basis changes on purposes the vendor does not declare as flexible, conflicting types for one vendor, and restrictions in a string that is not service-specific. `whenReady()`, `save()` and `generateTCString()` reject, and no TC string is written. Retrying `whenReady()` does not fetch another vendor list. With an explicit `gvl`, the error lasts for the handle and saving keeps failing even if the kernel later holds a different list; a CMP following the kernel's list checks a replacement list again. When a replacement vendor list makes a restriction unsupported, the TC authority confirmed under the previous list is cleared. Whenever the CMP withdraws its own authority, including on expiry, it also removes the `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry. A stored TC string whose restrictions differ from the configuration is not restored; the banner opens again for a returning visitor and closes once they save, IAB gates stay denied until then, and the superseded `euconsent-v2` cookie and localStorage entry are removed. Decoding a string written under TCF policy version 2 or 3 accepts legitimate interest required for purposes 3 to 6, which those versions allowed.

### Keep open tabs in step with stored consent

A choice saved in one tab now reaches the other open tabs on the same origin
without a reload. Before, a tab kept a grant after another tab stored a denial,
and neither `kernel.refresh()` nor `runtime.reinit()` read storage again.

Browser persistence reads stored records again when another tab on the same
origin changes a c15t localStorage key, when the page becomes visible and when
the window regains focus. A tab on another subdomain that shares the consent
cookie gets no `storage` event and catches up on its next focus or visibility
change, and so does every tab when localStorage is unavailable and only the
cookie is stored. Category decisions merge per category, keeping the newer decision for
each, and privacy directives merge as a union. A stored notice or vendor record
replaces the one in memory unless it is older. A record removed from storage is
cleared, so the active policy decides again. Blocked storage or bytes that do
not decode change nothing. Reconnecting does not read storage.

Queued writes follow the same rules. A tab lands its own pending write before it
reads, a choice write stores the per-category merge with what storage holds, a
directive write keeps every stored directive, and the rewrite that adds a
server subject id no longer recreates records another tab cleared. When two
tabs act in the same millisecond, the record stored first wins in both. A
tab that opened before another stored a subject joins the stored subject
unless it identified a different user; a subject id the server resolved is
kept unless a strictly newer stored choice carries another one. Only a
record this tab saw in storage is cleared when it disappears, so a choice
seeded while storage was blocked survives storage becoming readable.

Under an IAB policy, `@c15t/iab` loads the TC string another tab stored once
its choice is reconciled, with its purpose, vendor and special-feature
selections, so `__tcfapi` and the preference controls no longer show the
previous choice. Selections changed in this tab without saving are kept. A
TC string that grants any purpose of a category denied after it was saved
is withdrawn and not restored on the next page load; a partial purpose
selection saved through IAB keeps its TC string. A TC string confirmed before
the reconciled choice's newest decision, such as after a save on a sibling
subdomain that shares the consent cookie, is withdrawn as well, since the TC
string and its receipt belong to one origin. A newer receipt replaces the held
one even when the TC string is identical.

Clearing records now stores the clear epoch, the time of the clear, under
`c15t-epoch` in localStorage and a cookie of the same name, and clearing never
removes it. Every consent record written afterwards records its epoch too.
Decisions confirmed before the epoch are void everywhere: a tab that reconciles
after another tab cleared and saved again drops its pre-clear decisions, a tab
that missed the clear cannot write them back, and browser hydration and server
reads (`readStoredRecordsFromCookieHeader`) ignore them. A decision in the
clearing millisecond counts only from a tab that had seen the clear. Each clear
moves the epoch forward even after the clock went back, and an epoch up to an
hour ahead of the clock is kept. Records from before any clear, including v2
and legacy records, read as epoch 0 and are unaffected; a corrupt epoch also
reads as 0, and a record whose epoch field is corrupt is kept.

The consent cookie stays authoritative, but a denial in its localStorage copy
that is newer than the cookie's decision is now applied on top of it, so a
dropped cookie write no longer keeps an older grant in force. Copies written
under different clear epochs are cut to the later epoch first, and the
subject comes from the later copy. Privacy directives from both copies of the
privacy record apply, a newer local vendor list adds denials without lifting
any (a vendor copy from before the last clear is ignored), and the newer notice
dismissal applies. A newer local
grant is still not applied.

This changes the stored format: after a clear, the consent cookie gains
`&e=<time>` (16 bytes) and the localStorage record an `epoch` field (22 bytes).
Visitors who never cleared store what they did before. Older c15t builds reject
both the cookie and the localStorage record once they carry the epoch and treat
the visitor as undecided, so under an opt-out policy they grant optional
categories by default until a new choice is saved. Deploy the new build to every
page of the site before visitors can clear their records.

When two tabs write at the same moment and one write drops the other tab's
category or directive, the tab that lost it writes it back on its next
reconciliation, including directives it kept from storage in its own write.
Under an IAB policy, a TC string that grants a category a
reconciled denial covers is withdrawn before any `__tcfapi` listener is
notified, and one that predates another tab's newer choice is held back until
this tab reads that tab's receipt, so a revoked vendor is never advertised
again. A tab reloads the TC string when another tab stores a new receipt, which
covers a save in the same millisecond or one that changed only vendors, and
stops publishing the held one until the reload decides. Two receipts from the
same millisecond settle on the more restrictive one, so a revoked vendor is
never advertised again; when each grants something the other denies, the
stored receipt is removed and neither is published until the next save. When
another tab removes the receipt or clears localStorage, the held TC string is
withdrawn, and a receipt still being decoded is not installed. localStorage
has no conditional removal, so the removal after a tie can still delete a
receipt another tab stored a moment earlier; every tab then withholds its TC
string until the next save.

A page seeded from a server's cookie read applies newer denials and privacy
directives that reached only localStorage, and a local denial from the same
millisecond as a seeded grant, and a clear after the clock went
back more than an hour writes an epoch other tabs can still read. That capped
epoch cannot void decisions dated after it that a runtime which missed the
clear writes back; times alone cannot order a clear against a clock that went
back more than an hour. When the cookie and its localStorage copy hold
conflicting decisions from the same millisecond, the denial wins. The
subject comes from the cookie, which a server-side restoration or a sibling
subdomain can rewrite on its own, unless this browser's last write reached
only localStorage and the cookie has not changed since; such a write leaves a
`<storageKey>-cookie-miss` marker in localStorage. A localStorage write that
fails while the cookie write lands removes the older local copy.

New API:

- `runtime.reconcileStorage()` and `persistence.reconcile()` read stored
  records on demand and return whether anything changed. React's
  `usePersistence()` handle has `reconcile()` too.
- `persistence: { sync: false }` keeps storage but turns off the automatic
  reads. `dispose()` removes the listeners.

See [keep open tabs in step](https://c15t.com/docs/guides/consent-state#keep-open-tabs-in-step).

### Close consent surfaces without waiting for the backend

Save, Accept all and Reject all now close the preference dialog in the same
task as the click, in React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue, Nuxt, Svelte,
Astro's dialog islands and the browser client. The choice, storage, scripts,
iframes and network rules update from the local record first; the backend
request runs afterwards. Before, the dialog stayed open until the request
answered. In a Next.js production build with 170 ms of network latency, a 4x
CPU slowdown and a 200 ms backend, Save now closes the dialog after 18 ms
instead of 486 ms. The browser client's
banner waited the same way and now closes on the click too. IAB banners and
dialogs close on the click and come back only if the choice could not be
recorded locally, for example when the vendor list failed to load.

A failed request no longer keeps the dialog open or reopens it. The choice
stays, the failure reaches `onError` and the kernel's `command:error` event,
and the kernel replays the queued save after the next initialization or when
the browser comes back online.

Callback timing is unchanged: `onChoiceRecorded` and `onPermissionsChanged`
still run in the click task, and the promises returned by `performAction()`,
`saveConsents()` and the browser client's `save()` still settle when the
request does. Svelte's `ConsentButton` no longer leaves an unhandled rejection
when a save fails.

### Share script lifecycle with external consent providers

Add an external consent source to the framework-independent runtime, React, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte/SvelteKit, browser, and Astro entrypoints. Next.js and TanStack Start inherit the controls through React options. Provider decisions update effective gates without creating c15t receipts or mounting a second persistence layer. Route preference controls to the external provider through a shared kernel event, report errors through lifecycle callbacks, and reload the page when the source withdraws a granted category, using the existing `reloadOnConsentRevoked` option and `onBeforeConsentRevocationReload` callback. Keep React script modules lazy through a lightweight controls entrypoint.

Add consent-aware custom event and SPA pageview dispatch to the script SDK, preserve Google tag configuration, support custom GTM data layers and Segment load options, and declare the script SDK's core runtime dependency for isolated package installations.

Keep disabled runtimes permissive when an external source is configured. Complete browser readiness after connecting the source, keep Astro preference triggers available, and reject IAB saves owned by an external CMP. External permissions disable c15t IAB authority. Deliver events for built-in Umami, Rybbit and Matomo integrations, and preserve custom GTM queue names during initialization and dispatch.

Report external CMP subscription failures without aborting provider startup. Keep optional permissions denied and ignore notifications from the failed connection.

### Render theme CSS on the server

**Breaking.** The browser no longer generates theme CSS. `ConsentProvider` (and `ConsentRoot`) used to turn `options.theme` tokens into a `<style id="c15t-theme">` element on every page, so every visitor downloaded the theme generator and the default theme, about 1.7 KB gzip. The package stylesheet already carries the default tokens, so the provider now renders no theme style at all.

Render custom tokens with the new `ConsentTheme` component, exported from `@c15t/react`, `@c15t/nextjs`, `@c15t/tanstack-start` and the `c15t/react`, `c15t/next` and `c15t/tanstack-start` entries. It is not a client component: render it from a Server Component and the generator stays on the server. `ConsentTheme` takes `theme`, `colorScheme` (`'light'`, `'dark'` or `'system'`, applied before hydration) and `nonce`. `generateThemeCSS()` from `@c15t/ui/theme` now escapes `<`, so its output is safe inside a `<style>` element wherever you render it.

`@c15t/svelte`'s provider no longer injects the token CSS after hydration, which also removes the one-frame flash of default colors in SvelteKit. `@c15t/astro` now renders the integration's `theme` tokens on the server, next to the config script, instead of leaving them to the dialog islands.

### Migration

- **Next.js App Router.** Move the theme to a module without `'use client'`. Render `<ConsentTheme theme={theme} />` in the root layout (a Server Component) next to your consent wrapper, and pass `colorScheme` and `nonce` there if you set them on `ConsentRoot`. Keep `options.theme` on `ConsentRoot` only for `consentActions` and slot styles.
- **Next.js Pages Router.** Render `ConsentTheme` in `pages/_document.tsx`.
- **TanStack Start.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from a `createServerFn` handler in the root loader and render it in a `<style id="c15t-theme">` in the head. Rendering `ConsentTheme` in the root component also works but ships the generator.
- **React without server rendering.** Render `ConsentTheme` next to the provider (this ships the generator), or put the output of `generateThemeCSS(theme)` in your stylesheet.
- **SvelteKit.** Return `generateThemeCSS(theme)` from `+layout.server.ts` and render it inside `<svelte:head>`. Keep slot styles and `consentActions` in `options.theme`.
- **Astro.** Keep tokens in the integration's `theme`. Tokens in the client entrypoint's `theme` are no longer applied.
- **Light and dark at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` without `colorScheme` and toggle the `dark` class on `<html>` (for example with next-themes): its output holds both schemes. The provider's `colorScheme` option still keeps the `c15t-dark` class in sync after hydration.
- **Switching token sets at runtime.** Render `ConsentTheme` from a client component and change its props.
- Keep importing the package stylesheet. It holds the default tokens the provider used to inject.

In development, the provider warns when `theme` holds tokens but the page has no `c15t-theme` stylesheet.

### Keep the dialog and IAB styles out of the Svelte banner's first load

The overlay behind `ConsentBanner` imported the class maps of the consent
dialog, the IAB banner and the IAB dialog as well as the banner's own, so
every page with a banner shipped all four. Where a class map imports its
stylesheet, the IAB and dialog CSS came with them. The overlay now takes its
class names from the banner or dialog that renders it.

### Keep dialog CSS out of the render-blocking stylesheet

**Breaking.** `styles.css` now carries only what a first paint can show: the default tokens, every c15t CSS variable, and the rules for the banner, `ConsentDialogTrigger` and the `ConsentGate` placeholder. It shrinks from 125 KB to 66 KB (16.2 KB to 8.8 KB gzipped). The dialog and preference-widget rules moved to `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`, which the dialog's module imports, so your bundler ships them with the dialog's lazy chunk and applies them before the dialog renders. In a Next.js production build the page's stylesheet drops from 18.2 KB to 10.6 KB gzipped.

- `@c15t/ui/styles.css` and `styles.tw3.css` no longer contain the dialog, preference widget, accordion, switch, tabs, collapsible, preference item or vendor list rules. React, Next.js and TanStack Start load them for you. If you render `@c15t/ui` class maps for those parts in your own components, import `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`.
- `@c15t/react/primitives` and every `@c15t/react/primitives/*` entry load the dialog stylesheet, because the accordion, collapsible, preference item, switch and tabs rules moved there.
- JavaScript loads the dialog rules through the new `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog` module. Bundlers follow its import of `styles/dialog.css`; under the `node` export condition it imports nothing, so plain Node (the Pages Router, or SSR that keeps dependencies external) can load every `@c15t/react` entry. Import it instead of the `.css` file from components that can run on the server.
- The rules for the `@c15t/ui/styles/primitives` class maps moved to `@c15t/ui/styles/primitives.css`. The React components never used them. `c15t/svelte/styles.css` imports them; other hosts that render those class maps import the file themselves.
- `iab/styles.css` no longer repeats the default tokens and the shared rules. Import it after `styles.css`, as the IAB guides already say.
- Tailwind 3: the dialog stylesheet goes through your PostCSS pipeline, and Tailwind 3 rejects its `@layer components` block. Add `@c15t/ui/postcss-tailwind3` before `tailwindcss` in your PostCSS plugins. Without it the build fails with "`@layer components` is used but no matching `@tailwind components` directive is present".
- If you import `styles.css` into a named layer (`@import '…/styles.css' layer(c15t)`), the dialog rules still join the top-level `components` layer.

Svelte, Astro, Vue and the script-tag build render the same styles as before. `c15t/svelte/styles.css` still holds every rule, because Svelte loads its dialog with the page. Astro injects the banner rules; the React and Svelte dialog islands import the rest, which Astro links on every page, and with `ui: 'vue'` the integration injects them. If you set `styles: false` with `ui: 'vue'`, also import `@c15t/ui/styles/dialog.css`. `@c15t/browser` inlines the dialog rules as before.

### Stop a slow or unreachable backend from holding SvelteKit pages

`loadConsent` from `@c15t/svelte/kit` now waits at most `timeoutMs` (500 ms by
default) for the init route or the backend `/init`. Before, the documented
awaited `+layout.server.ts` held every page until the backend answered: with
`backendURL`, a backend that accepted the connection and never replied kept
the page from sending a byte until Node's own fetch timeout, and with
`initRoute`, a cold manifest cache held it for the manifest cache's 10 second
timeout.

When the budget runs out, `loadConsent` returns the stored choice and request
context without a policy, as it already did when the call failed. The page
renders without consent UI in the server HTML, optional categories stay
denied, and the browser resolves the policy and shows the banner after
hydration. A hosted `/init` request is aborted. An init route request keeps
running, through the platform's `waitUntil` where the adapter provides one,
and fills the manifest cache for the next render. It sends no session report,
since the browser's own init reports that page view. A `timeoutMs` that is not
a finite, non-negative number uses the 500 ms default.

### Migration

- Pages whose backend takes longer than 500 ms now render the banner after
  hydration on that request instead of in the server HTML. Raise the budget
  with `loadConsent(event, { backendURL, timeoutMs: 1500 })`, or pass
  `timeoutMs: false` to wait as before.

### Load the Svelte consent dialog after the first paint

`ConsentDialog` from `@c15t/svelte` no longer ships in the page's first load.
The dialog, the preference widget inside it and their primitives load in
their own chunk, before the first open:

- in browser idle time after the page's load event, while a button that opens
  the dialog is mounted (the banner's Customize button, `ConsentDialogLink`,
  `ConsentDialogTrigger` or the `ConsentGate` placeholder);
- when one of those buttons is hovered or focused;
- at the latest when the dialog opens.

Idle loading is skipped with Save-Data, on 2G connections and offline. Set
`preloadDialog: 'intent'` in the provider options to load the dialog only on
hover, focus or open. If the load fails as the dialog opens, the banner or
trigger that opened it comes back, and the next hover, focus or open retries
the load.

`ConsentDialog`'s own `showTrigger` trigger now appears once the dialog chunk
has loaded, right after hydration, instead of in the server HTML. Render
`ConsentDialogTrigger` next to the dialog to keep it in the server HTML.

## @c15t/svelte@3.0.0-alpha.2 (alpha)

### Session reports from manifest mode

A host that resolves init from a cached manifest never calls `/init`, so the backend could not count the visitors it served. Every server-side resolution now sends `POST /sessions` to the backend after the fact, server-to-server and detached from the response: the Next.js, TanStack Start, SvelteKit, Nuxt and Astro init routes, and the Next.js, TanStack Start and Astro render-time prefetches. The report carries the manifest revision, the matched policy, the jurisdiction, country, region, language and GPC signal. The visitor's user agent travels as `User-Agent` and the visitor's single client address on a dedicated `X-C15T-Client-IP` header, which the backend masks and records under its `ipAddress` settings; the forwarding chain itself is not sent, and neither are cookies. The browser makes no request.

`@c15t/backend` adds the `POST /sessions` route and a `sessions.onReport` option. Reports are written to the request's wide event and handed to the sink; nothing is stored. The backend's own `/init` emits the same event, so one sink sees hosted and manifest traffic alike.

Reports are handed to the same `onBackgroundRevalidate` hook as a background manifest refresh, so a host that already passes `after` or a platform `waitUntil` needs no change. `resolveConsent` in `@c15t/nextjs/server` gains `waitUntil` for the App Router. Set `reportSessions: false` on any adapter to send none. `createManifestTransport` in `@c15t/core` gains a `report` option; `@c15t/schema` adds `consentSessionReportSchema` and `buildConsentSessionReport`.

### Rename `Frame` to `ConsentGate`

`Frame` is now `ConsentGate` in React, Next.js, TanStack Start and Svelte, and Vue's `ConsentFrame` is now `ConsentGate`. The compound parts follow: `ConsentGate.Root`, `ConsentGate.Title` and `ConsentGate.Button`, with `ConsentGateProps` and `ConsentGateCompoundComponent` types. New subpaths are `c15t/react/consent-gate`, `c15t/react/components/consent-gate` and `@c15t/vue/runtime/components/consent-gate.vue`, and Nuxt auto-registers `<ConsentGate>`.

The old names, subpaths and Nuxt component remain as deprecated aliases for the same component. Props, behavior, `frame.*` translation keys, `--frame-*` CSS custom properties and `data-testid="frame-placeholder"` are unchanged.

### Granular consent

Grant a category and still turn one vendor off, outside IAB TCF. Declare vendors with the `vendors` option or the backend manifest, then name them with `vendor` on scripts and network rules and `data-vendor` on iframes. A target loads when its category passes and its vendor is not off; `alwaysLoad` scripts see the result in their callbacks.

The preference centers in React, Next.js, TanStack Start, Vue, Nuxt and Svelte list each category's vendors with a switch per vendor. Switches edit the draft and record on Save, disable while the category is off, and clear on Accept all and Reject all. React adds `useVendorDraft`, `useVendorAllowed`, `useDeclaredVendors` and `useVendorChoice`; `useConsentDraft` gains `vendors` and `setVendor`; the Svelte manager state gains `selectedVendors` and `setSelectedVendor`.

Denials persist in a `<storageKey>-vendors` cookie and localStorage entry and reach the backend as `vendorChoice`. Migration `4-vendor-choice` adds the column, so run the migrator before deploying. A denial has no expiry and does not delete cookies the vendor already set.

Also fixed: the Vue preference center rendered its switches and category rows unstyled in Nuxt, and the Vue and Svelte category description colour differed from React's.

### Restore category discovery and consent completion

Restore category discovery from scripts, frames, and network rules. Merge discovered categories with `consentCategories` within the policy scope, and use the same set for the dialog and consent completion. Keep the banner dismissed after accepting the displayed categories and reloading. Enable tagged iframe discovery and blocking by default in React, matching the shared runtime.

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

- dd44a61: Add opt-in `clearOnRevocation` configuration to remove declared cookies, localStorage keys, and sessionStorage keys when their consent category is denied or revoked. Support exact names, prefix patterns, and cookie scopes while protecting c15t consent records.

## 3.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

- 4460e3e: This v3 alpha is for internal use only. APIs are unstable, and breaking changes will occur between alpha releases.

  Introduce the c15t umbrella package, shared consent runtime and policy rules, rewritten backend, and new framework and script-tag integrations. Update the CLI, IAB support, DevTools, and shared styles for v3.

  Packages now ship ESM only. Keep related packages on compatible v3 alpha versions.

  Export `defineTheme` and the `Theme` type from the React, Next.js, TanStack Start, and Vue entries so themes can use the same imports as their framework integration.

  Restrict iframe-blocker URL activation to HTTP and HTTPS. Replace backtracking URL and theme parsing expressions, correct the PostHog hostname boundary, and fix CLI layout detection for nested route groups and locale directories.

  Serve a stale consent manifest from the server adapters' in-process cache inside the backend's `stale-while-revalidate` window while one background request revalidates it, instead of blocking every request after `s-maxage` expires; a failed or timed-out revalidation keeps the stale manifest. The backend sends its manifest cache policy as `CDN-Cache-Control` too, so Vercel's CDN forwards it. Add `onBackgroundRevalidate` to the core cache and every server adapter for runtimes that stop detached work after the response.
