## Using these docs

These docs describe c15t v3. Find the app in Choose your setup, then follow that framework guide from start to finish; it names the files to create and the backend URL to use. Install c15t packages with the @alpha dist-tag, because npm latest is still v2. A visible banner does not prove anything: check that vendor requests wait for consent, that rejection survives a reload, and that preferences can be reopened.

## Start here

- [JavaScript quickstart](./docs/frameworks/javascript/quickstart.md)
- [Choose your setup](./docs/concepts/choose-your-setup.md): Pick the c15t setup for your framework, rendering mode and hosting, and decide who runs the consent backend.
- [How consent works](./docs/concepts/how-consent-works.md): What c15t decides on each page load, the difference between a permission and a recorded choice, and what happens when a visitor saves.
- [Customize your consent interface](./docs/customization/overview.md): Choose presentation, theme tokens, slots or custom markup for the change you need.
- [Verify consent](./docs/guides/verify-consent.md): Check in a production build that vendor requests wait for consent, rejection survives a reload, preferences reopen and privacy signals apply.
- [Migrate to v3](./docs/upgrade-v3.md): Upgrade a c15t v2 app to v3. Covers packages, the Next.js and React providers, the JavaScript runtime, custom UI built on useConsentManager, callbacks, policies, stored consent and a self-hosted backend.
