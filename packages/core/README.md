Headless JavaScript consent management platform for cookie banners, privacy preferences, consent storage, and consent-aware script gating.

## Key Features

- Cookie consent: Build consent flows for banners, dialogs, and preference centers
- Headless APIs: Own the UI while c15t manages consent state and persistence
- Framework agnostic: Works across JavaScript and TypeScript applications
- Script gating: Connect to @c15t/scripts for Google Tag Manager, Consent Mode v2, Meta Pixel, and more
- Server-side rendering support: Compatible with SSR frameworks
- Internationalization: Built-in translation support

## Prerequisites

- JavaScript or TypeScript project
- Node.js 18.17.0 or later
- npm, pnpm, or yarn package manager
- A hosted [c15t instance](https://inth.com) (free sign-up), [self-hosted deployment](https://c15t.com/docs/self-host/quickstart), or offline mode for local-only storage

## Quick Start

Easiest setup with @c15t/cli:

```bash
# Set up c15t in your project
pnpm dlx @c15t/cli setup
# Alternatives:
# npx @c15t/cli setup
# bunx --bun @c15t/cli setup
```

The CLI will:

- Install necessary packages
- Configure your c15t instance
- Set up environment variables
- Add consent management components to your app

## Manual Installation

```bash
pnpm add c15t
```

To manually install, follow the guide in our [docs – manual setup](https://c15t.com/docs/frameworks/javascript/quickstart#manual-setup).

## Usage

1. Import the c15t core library
2. Configure your consent preferences
3. Manage user consent across your application
4. Customize consent banners and preference centers
5. For full implementation details, see the [JavaScript quickstart docs](https://c15t.com/docs/frameworks/javascript/quickstart)

```typescript
// Example usage
import { ConsentManager } from 'c15t'

const consentManager = new ConsentManager({
  // Your configuration
})
```
