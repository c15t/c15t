## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

### **c15t**

* Added `experimental_globalPrivacyControl` option. This will respect the Global Privacy Control signal in opt-out jurisdictions, like California (CCPA). This is set to `false` by default.
* Fixed auto-grant ignoring existing consents.
* Fixed offline mode ignoring overrides.
* Fixed auto-grant not updating selected consents.

### **@c15t/react**

* Fixed custom styling support for dialog and accordion.
