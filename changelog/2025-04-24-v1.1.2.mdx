## Major Changes

This release introduces **optimistic UI updates** and achieves **massive bundle size reduction** while adding a new **headless package** for maximum flexibility.

## 🔧 Fixes & Improvements

### @c15t/react@1.1.2

#### Improved UX responsiveness for banner and dialog interactions:
- UI now updates immediately on user interaction (e.g., closing modals, accepting/rejecting consent), with consent saved in the background
- This ensures a smoother experience, especially on slower connections or when network requests are delayed

#### Improved event handling for ConsentButton:
- Rewritten logic to separate UI updates from consent persistence
- Custom onClick handlers now receive the full MouseEvent, enabling better control and integration

#### Cleaner store logic:
- Refactored setShowPopup and saveConsents methods to better separate UI vs network logic
- More consistent behavior around locale changes and popup visibility

### c15t@1.0.5

#### ⚙️ Under the Hood:
- Improved consent flow by decoupling UI updates from async network calls — UI now responds instantly, with API sync happening in the background
- Fixed an edge case where popup visibility or dialog state could behave inconsistently due to dependency timing
- Minor cleanup and better error handling in consent persistence logic

## 🚀 Performance Revolution

### Bundle Size Optimization
- **MASSIVE**: Reduced package size from **84.2 kB → 34.6 kB** (gzip) — a **58.9% reduction**
- Removed framer-motion dependency for lighter bundle
- Replaced Tailwind variants with native transitions and utility classes
- **Zero compromise** on UX while achieving faster load times

## 🧠 New Headless Package

### @c15t/react/headless
- **NEW**: Introduced `@c15t/react/headless` for teams who need full UI control
- **Ultra-lightweight**: Only **12.5 kB (gzip)** footprint
- Perfect for custom implementations and design systems
- Complete access to consent logic without built-in UI components

## ✨ What's Changed

- feat: Optimistic UI updates by [@BurnedChris](https://github.com/BurnedChris) in [#184](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/pull/184)

**Full Changelog**: [1.1.1...1.1.2](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/compare/1.1.1...1.1.2)

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Optimistic Consent Flow
```js
// Optimistic consent flow
const handleConsent = async (choice) => {
  // 1. Update UI immediately (optimistic)
  updateUIState(choice);
  
  // 2. Save to backend (background)
  try {
    await saveConsent(choice);
  } catch (error) {
    // 3. Revert UI if needed
    revertUIState();
  }
};
```

### Enhanced Event Handling
```jsx
<ConsentButton 
  onClick={(event: MouseEvent) => {
    // Full access to mouse event
    // Custom logic before/after consent handling
    handleCustomAnalytics(event);
  }}
>
  Accept Cookies
</ConsentButton>
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Plan
✅ **Scenario 1**: Clicking the "Accept All" button on cookie banner
- Expected: Banner immediately disappears, consent is saved in the background

✅ **Scenario 2**: Testing on slow networks
- Using Chrome DevTools to simulate slow 3G connection
- Expected: UI updates immediately regardless of network speed

### Edge Cases
- Error handling: If the network request fails, the UI is already updated, and errors are logged
- Performance: Significant improvement in perceived performance on all device types

This release makes c15t **leaner, faster, and more flexible than ever** while maintaining full backward compatibility and enhancing the user experience through optimistic UI updates.
