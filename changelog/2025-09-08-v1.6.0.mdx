## âœ¨ New Features

### Better Callbacks

We've overhauled the callback system to make it more easy to use and removed a lot of unused callbacks. 

The current callbacks are:

- `onBannerFetched`
- `onConsentSet`
- `onError`

The performance of the callbacks has also been improved (see issue [#369](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/issues/369)), resulting in improved INP scores when using callbacks or GTM.

### backend/v2

The old backend wasn't to our standards and was difficult to implement due to poor documentation. 
On top of addressing the documentation issues, we've migrated from our own database adapters to [FumaDB](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadb).
This enables support for more databases & ORMs like TypeORM, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, and more coming soon.

If you have an existing backend v1 implementation, we have a [migration guide](/docs/self-host/migrate-from-v1) to help you.

We plan to remove support for the old backend in the next major release.

### Improved checking consent

We've added a new method `has()` to the API for checking consent, this is available across all frameworks and allows for simple and complex consent checks. 

```ts
// Simple check
const hasAnalytics = has('measurement');
const hasMarketing = has('marketing');

// Complex check
const hasAnalyticsAndMarketing = has({
  and: ['measurement', 'marketing'],
})

const hasEitherAnalyticsOrMarketing = has({
  or: ['measurement', 'marketing'],
})
```

You can read more about the `has()` method in the [API documentation](/docs/frameworks/javascript/store/checking-consent).

This change has led us to deprecate `hasConsentFor()` and `getEffectiveConsents()`, these will be removed in the next major release.

### RTL support

c15t now supports RTL languages on its prebuilt components allowing you to use the components in any language.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

### @c15t/react

- Fixed a bug where the dialog overlay was not showing by default.
- Improved the export of compound components, now you can import them directly from the `@c15t/react` package.

### @c15t/core

- Deprecated various unused methods and properties to clean up the API.
- Improved fallback for when the showConsentBanner API request fails.

### @c15t/translations

- Added Hebrew translations.

## Dependency Updates

### @c15t/backend
