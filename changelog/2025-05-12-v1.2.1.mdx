## Summary

This release delivers a major refactor and architecture upgrade across the API system, along with enhanced translation handling, styling fixes, and groundwork for future CLI and dashboard features. It introduces a type-safe Node.js SDK, centralized routing, and better configuration defaults ‚Äî paving the way for production-ready scaling.

- Support for **common translation strings** across UI components
- Early support for **dev vs prod** instance logic and origin handling

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Improved schema validation for `setConsent`
- Fixed environment variable parsing for trusted origins
- Improved fallback handling for translations and jurisdiction detection

## üß™ Tests

- Added test coverage for new consent contracts and schema validation
- Extended coverage for translations, error handling, and Node.js SDK
- Cleaned up outdated tests and fixtures

## üßπ Refactor

- Migrated backend from H3 to **oRPC** for improved type safety
