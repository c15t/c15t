## Global Privacy Control (GPC) 

This release adds first-class support for Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals across the core store
and backend. If a browser sends a GPC signal, the consent manager now:

- Applies stricter defaults for tracking categories.
- Reflects GPC-driven state in the consent UI and callbacks.
- Exposes helpers so you can detect and react to GPC in custom flows.

## 💥 Breaking changes

- **Backend v1 removed, v2 promoted to default**: the deprecated `v1` backend implementation and
  `/v1` routes have been removed. The former `v2` contracts, handlers, and types have been moved
  to the top-level backend entrypoints. If you were still relying on `v1`, you must migrate to the
  current backend API surface.
- **`/show-consent-banner` endpoint replaced with `/init`**: the endpoint has been renamed with a more accurate name (initialization).
  (geo data, consent info, translations, etc.). Any custom integrations calling
  `/show-consent-banner` should update to use `/init`.
- **`showConsentBanner` prop removed in favour of jurisdiction-based flow**: the old
  `showConsentBanner` flag has been removed from the SDK. Instead, banner visibility is now driven
  by jurisdiction and model detection, with built-in support for opt-out banners. Update any custom
  logic that toggled `showConsentBanner` to use the new jurisdiction-aware configuration.
- **Tracking blocker removed, replaced with network blocker**: the legacy tracking blocker and
  related types have been removed. It is replaced by the new **network blocker** module, which
  intercepts `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest` and blocks requests based on consent and domain rules. Use the
  new `networkBlocker` configuration in the store and corresponding helpers to migrate.
- **Deprecated store options cleaned up**: several previously deprecated store options and
  deep-imports have been removed as part of the new `store/index.ts` API. If you were importing
  store internals directly, switch to the documented `createConsentManagerStore` and
  `StoreOptions` types instead.

## ✨ New features

- **Network blocker**: new network-blocker module that lets you configure domain-based blocking of
  network requests based on consent, replacing the older tracking blocker implementation.
- **GPC-aware consent flows**: store helpers and backend logic that make it easy to honour Global
  Privacy Control signals by default.
- **Smaller backend responses**: backend `init`/geo responses are now compressed, reducing payload
  size for geo-location requests by around 14%.
- **Translations helper**: new `selectLanguage` helper and cached language key in the translations
  package to make language selection and caching more predictable.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

- **Core & backend types tightened**: store types, backend contracts, and options have been
  refactored to be easier to navigate and harder to misuse, while keeping the public surface area
  stable where possible.
- **Tests & tooling**: tests have been updated to the new v2 defaults (including node SDK and core
  store), CI bundle analysis has been improved, and unused internals have been removed.
