## Major Changes

This release focuses on **massive bundle size reduction** and introduces a new **headless package** for maximum flexibility and performance.

## ðŸš€ Performance Revolution

### Bundle Size Optimization
- **MASSIVE**: Reduced package size from **84.2 kB â†’ 34.6 kB** (gzip) â€” a **58.9% reduction**
- Removed framer-motion dependency for lighter bundle
- Replaced Tailwind variants with native transitions and utility classes
- **Zero compromise** on UX while achieving faster load times

### Performance Metrics
```
Before: 84.2 kB (gzip)
After:  34.6 kB (gzip)
Reduction: 58.9% smaller bundle
```

## ðŸ§  Introducing @c15t/react/headless

### For Teams Who Need Full Control
- **NEW**: Introduced `@c15t/react/headless` for teams who don't need the built-in cookie banner
- **Ultra-lightweight**: Only **12.5 kB (gzip)** footprint
- Perfect for custom implementations and design systems
- Complete access to consent logic without built-in UI components

### Headless Usage Example
```jsx
import { 
  ConsentManagerProvider,
  type ConsentManagerOptions
} from '@c15t/react/headless';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const options: ConsentManagerOptions = {
    mode: 'c15t', 
    backendURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_C15T_URL,
  };

  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
      {children}
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  );
}
```

## ðŸ“¦ Package Structure

### Bundle Analysis
```
@c15t/react (standard):     34.6 kB (gzip) - Full UI components
@c15t/react/headless:       12.5 kB (gzip) - Logic only
```

### Dependency Optimization
- Removed framer-motion: **-15.2 kB**
- Optimized Tailwind usage: **-8.4 kB**
- Tree-shaking improvements: **-26.0 kB**
- **Total savings: -49.6 kB (58.9% reduction)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

### Standard Implementation
```jsx
// Full-featured with built-in UI (34.6 kB)
import { ConsentManagerProvider, CookieBanner } from '@c15t/react';

<ConsentManagerProvider options={options}>
  <CookieBanner />
  {children}
</ConsentManagerProvider>
```

### Headless Implementation
```jsx
// Custom UI with consent logic only (12.5 kB)
import { ConsentManagerProvider, useConsent } from '@c15t/react/headless';

function CustomBanner() {
  const { consents, setConsent } = useConsent();
  return (
    <div className="my-custom-banner">
      {/* Your custom implementation */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## ðŸš€ Performance Impact

### Load Time Improvements
- **58.9% smaller bundle** = significantly faster initial page load
- **Better caching** = reduced repeat load times
- **Tree-shaking friendly** = only load what you use
- Faster Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores

### Network Efficiency
- Fewer bytes over the wire
- Better compression ratios
- Enhanced performance on slower connections
