## Patch Changes

- fix(react): ensure provider `theme` is applied to `ConsentManagerWidget` and `ConsentManagerDialog` ([357dcd7](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/357dcd7648ff3adb4799b06fe788de06a529f1c8))
- fix(react): ensure `CookieBanner` correctly inherits provider `theme` and global `classNames`/`styles` ([c463eda](https://github.com/c15t/c15t/commit/c463eda67126d7aefa483ea46ffdd7aa24462559))

## Usage Notes

- No changes required for apps already passing a `theme` to `ConsentManagerProvider` — components now consistently inherit the provider theme.

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    mode: 'c15t',
    backendURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_C15T_URL,
    theme: {
      classNames: 'rounded-lg shadow-md',
      styles: { '--c15t-accent': '#4f46e5' },
    },
  }}
>
  <CookieBanner />
  <ConsentManagerDialog />
  <ConsentManagerWidget />
</ConsentManagerProvider>
```
