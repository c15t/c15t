## ✨ New Features

### Hybrid Cookie/LocalStorage Approach for consent

This update changes how we store consent in the browser, from using local-storage only to a hybrid approach with both cookies & local storage.

Cookies will now allow you to check consent on the server side & persist consent across subdomains e.g. `dashboard.example.com` & `example.com`.

To enable this, you use the `storageConfig` option. 

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    storageConfig: {
      storageKey: 'my-consent', // Custom override for local storage + cookie key 
      crossSubdomain: true,
    },
  }}
>
```

Existing consent under the old `privacy-consent-storage` key will be automatically migrated to the new `c15t` key.

### Configurable Legal Links

You can now add various legal links to the consent manager. This can be used to display links in the consent banner, dialog, etc.

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    legalLinks: {
      privacyPolicy: { href: '/privacy-policy' },
      termsOfService: { href: '/terms-of-service' },
      cookiePolicy: { href: '/cookie-policy' },
    },
  }}
>
```

You can filter what legal links you want to display (if any) on the pre-made components by passing the `legalLinks` prop.

```tsx
// Show no legal links (default)
<CookieBanner />

// Show both cookie policy and terms of service
<CookieBanner legalLinks={['cookiePolicy', 'termsOfService']} />

```

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 16, maxHeight: 250, alignItems: 'flex-start', overflow: 'visible' }}>
  <img
    src="https://qawfa2yzgrix7k7v.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/changelogs/1.8.0-Legal-Links-Banner.png"
    alt="Legal Links Banner"
    style={{ maxHeight: 250, objectFit: 'contain', borderRadius: 8, boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)' }}
  />
  <img
    src="https://qawfa2yzgrix7k7v.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/changelogs/1.8.0-Legal-Links-Dialog.png"
    alt="Legal Links Dialog"
    style={{ maxHeight: 250, objectFit: 'contain', borderRadius: 8, boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)' }}
  />
</div>

### User Identification

We've enabled user identification in the consent manager. This allows you to link a user's ID to a consent record both before & after consent is given.

An external ID can be set in various ways: 

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    user: {
      id: 'usr_foobar',
      identityProvider: 'better-auth',
    }
  }}
>

// Or via the `identifyUser` method in the Store
const { identifyUser } = useConsentManager();

identifyUser({
  id: 'usr_foobar',
  identityProvider: 'better-auth',
});
```

This change also brings a new endpoint to the backend: `PATCH /consent/identify`. So you'll need to update your backend to support this new endpoint.

### All 24 Official Languages of the European Union

We've added support for all 24 official languages of the European Union as well as additional languages to the translations package bringing the total number of supported languages to 33.

Current languages include:

| | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bulgarian (bg) | Czech (cs) | Danish (da) | German (de) | Greek (el) | English (en) | Spanish (es) |
| Estonian (et) | Finnish (fi) | French (fr) | Irish (ga) | Hebrew (he) | Croatian (hr) | Hungarian (hu) |
| Indonesian (id) | Italian (it) | Lithuanian (lt) | Latvian (lv) | Maltese (mt) | Dutch (nl) | Polish (pl) |
| Portuguese (pt) | Romanian (ro) | Slovak (sk) | Slovenian (sl) | Swedish (sv) | Chinese (zh) | Welsh (cy) |
| Icelandic (is) | Luxembourgish (lb) | Norwegian Bokmål (nb) | Norwegian Nynorsk (nn) | Romansh (rm) | | |

### Script Loader Target Location

The script loader now supports specifying the target location of the script in the DOM. This is useful for scripts that need to be loaded in the body of the document.

This can be done with the `target` option, which defaults to `head` if not specified.

```tsx
{
  id: 'example',
  src: 'https://analytics.example.com/script.js',
  category: 'analytics',
  target: 'body',
}
```
