## ✨ New Features

### Hybrid Cookie/LocalStorage Approach for consent

This update changes how we store consent in the browser, from using local-storage only to a hybrid approach with both cookies & local storage.

Cookies will now allow you to check consent on the server side & persist consent across subdomains e.g. `dashboard.example.com` & `example.com`.

To enable this, you use the `storageConfig` option. 

```tsx
<ConsentManagerProvider
  options={{
    storageConfig: {
      storageKey: 'my-consent', // Custom override for local storage + cookie key 
      crossSubdomain: true,
    },
  }}
>
```

Existing consent under the old `privacy-consent-storage` key will be automatically migrated to the new `c15t` key.

More changes will be added soon...
