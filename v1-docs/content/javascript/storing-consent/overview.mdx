description: 'Compare different approaches to storing consent decisions in your application'
---

c15t provides multiple approaches for storing consent decisions in your application. Each approach has different tradeoffs in terms of:

- Server requirements
- Data persistence
- Implementation complexity
- User experience

## Available Storage Options

| Storage Option | Description | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Hosted c15t** | Using consent.io managed service | Production apps with minimal backend maintenance |
| **Self-Hosting** | Running your own c15t backend | Organizations requiring complete data control |
| **Offline Mode** | Browser-based storage with no server | Simple implementations or dev environments |

<Callout type="tip">
  For most applications, we recommend starting with Hosted c15t (consent.io) for the simplest setup with the most features.
</Callout>

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Hosted c15t (Recommended)

[consent.io](https://consent.io) provides a fully managed consent management backend with:

- Zero backend maintenance
- Built-in scaling and automatic updates
- Geographic jurisdiction detection
- Analytics dashboard

### Self-Hosting

Run your own c15t instance to maintain complete control over your data and infrastructure:

- Full control over data storage and security
- Integration with your existing database systems
- Customizable configuration
- No external service dependencies

### Offline Mode

Store consent decisions entirely in the browser without any server:

- Zero backend requirements
- Simplest implementation
- Works offline and in statically-hosted sites
- Perfect for development or simple use cases

## Decision Guide

<Callout>
Use this decision tree to determine which storage option best fits your needs.
</Callout>

1. **Do you need consent data to persist across devices?**
   - No → Consider **Offline Mode**
   - Yes → Continue to question 2

2. **Do you need complete control over your consent data?**
   - No → Use **Hosted c15t** (consent.io)
   - Yes → Continue to question 3

3. **Do you have an existing consent management system?**
   - No → Use **Self-Hosting**
   - Yes → Consider **Custom Client**

## Creating a Client

The main factory function `configureConsentManager` creates the appropriate client implementation based on the provided options:

```tsx
import { configureConsentManager, type ConsentManagerOptions } from 'c15t';

export const c15tConfig = {
	mode: 'c15t',
	backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev',
} satisfies ConsentManagerOptions;

const consentManager = configureConsentManager(c15tConfig);
```

## Global Callback Events

All client modes support the following callback events:

```tsx
const callbacks = {
  // Called when any request fails
  onError: (response, path) => {
    console.error(`Request to ${path} failed:`, response.error);
  },
  
  // Called after successfully fetching consent banner information
  onConsentBannerFetched: (response) => {
    console.log('Banner info fetched:', response.data);
  },
  
  // Called after successfully setting consent preferences
  onConsentSet: (response) => {
    console.log('Consent set successfully:', response.data);
  },
  
  // Called after successfully verifying consent
  onConsentVerified: (response) => {
    console.log('Consent verified:', response.data);
  }
};
```

## When to Use Each Mode

<Callout>
  Choosing the right mode depends on your specific requirements and constraints.
</Callout>

- **c15t Mode**: For production applications with a real c15t backend
- **Offline Mode**: For production applications with your own backend systems, or when you want to eliminate external service dependencies
- **Custom Mode**: When you need to integrate with an existing consent system but still want to implement custom HTTP request handling

## What's Next
