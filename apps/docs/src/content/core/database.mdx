title: Database
---

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the database schema used in the C15T consent management system.

## Overview

The consent management system uses a PostgreSQL database with a carefully designed schema to track user consent in compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws. The schema enables:

- Recording and tracking user consent for various purposes
- Managing consent withdrawal/revocation
- Maintaining detailed audit trails
- Supporting geographic/jurisdictional considerations
- Ensuring data integrity through relationships and constraints

## Core Tables

The database is organized around the following key concepts:

### Users

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
  is_identified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  external_id VARCHAR(255),
  identity_provider VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `users` table tracks both anonymous and identified individuals. Each user has a random UUID that serves as their public identifier, separate from the internal auto-incrementing ID.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| user_id | UUID | Public identifier for the user, randomly generated |
| is_identified | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this is an anonymous user (false) or an identified user (true) |
| external_id | VARCHAR(255) | Optional identifier from a third-party identity provider (e.g., ClerkID) |
| identity_provider | VARCHAR(50) | Name of the external identity provider (e.g., 'clerk', 'auth0') |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the user record was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the user record was last updated |

### Consents

```sql
CREATE TABLE consents (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
  domain_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES domains(id),
  preferences JSONB NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB NOT NULL,
  policy_version VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  ip_address INET,
  region VARCHAR(50),
  given_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  valid_until TIMESTAMPTZ,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);
```

The `consents` table is the core of the system, storing explicit consent records given by users. Each record includes:

- Which user gave consent (`user_id`)
- The domain the consent applies to (`domain_id`)
- Preferences as a JSON object mapping purposes to boolean values
- Contextual metadata about how the consent was obtained
- The privacy policy version shown to the user
- IP address and region information for regulatory compliance
- Timestamps for when consent was given and when it expires (if applicable)
- Active status flag

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| user_id | UUID | Reference to the user giving consent |
| domain_id | INTEGER | Reference to the domain for which consent is given |
| preferences | JSONB | JSON object mapping consent purposes to boolean values |
| metadata | JSONB | Context about how consent was obtained |
| policy_version | VARCHAR(20) | Version of the privacy policy shown to the user |
| ip_address | INET | IP address of the user at the time consent was given |
| region | VARCHAR(50) | Geographic region code where consent was given |
| given_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When consent was provided |
| valid_until | TIMESTAMPTZ | Optional expiration date for this consent |
| is_active | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this is the currently active consent record |

### Consent Withdrawals

```sql
CREATE TABLE consent_withdrawals (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  consent_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES consents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  revoked_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  revocation_reason TEXT,
  method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  actor VARCHAR(100),
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `consent_withdrawals` table tracks when and how users revoke previously granted consent. This dedicated table maintains a clear audit trail of withdrawal events while preserving the original consent record for compliance purposes.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| consent_id | INTEGER | Reference to the consent being withdrawn |
| revoked_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When consent was revoked |
| revocation_reason | TEXT | Optional explanation for the withdrawal |
| method | VARCHAR(50) | Method used for withdrawal (e.g., 'web_form', 'api_call', 'customer_service') |
| actor | VARCHAR(100) | Entity that performed the withdrawal (user ID or system identifier) |
| metadata | JSONB | Additional context about the withdrawal (device info, etc.) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the withdrawal record was created |

### Consent Purposes

```sql
CREATE TABLE consent_purposes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_essential BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  data_category VARCHAR(50),
  legal_basis VARCHAR(50),
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `consent_purposes` table defines different reasons for which personal data may be processed, such as "analytics", "marketing", or "functional". Each purpose includes details about the legal basis for processing and the category of data involved.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| code | VARCHAR(50) | Unique code identifying the purpose (e.g., 'analytics', 'marketing') |
| name | VARCHAR(100) | Human-readable name of the purpose |
| description | TEXT | Detailed explanation of what this purpose entails |
| is_essential | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this purpose is essential for service operation |
| data_category | VARCHAR(50) | Category of personal data used for this purpose (e.g., 'profile', 'behavior') |
| legal_basis | VARCHAR(50) | Legal basis for data processing (e.g., 'consent', 'legitimate_interest') |
| is_active | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this purpose definition is currently active |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the purpose was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the purpose was last updated |

### Consent Records

```sql
CREATE TABLE consent_records (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  consent_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES consents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  record_type consent_record_type NOT NULL,
  record_type_detail VARCHAR(100),
  content JSONB NOT NULL,
  ip_address INET,
  record_metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `consent_records` table stores evidence and an audit trail of consent actions. The `record_type` field uses a PostgreSQL enum with values like "form_submission", "banner_interaction", and "withdrawal".

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| consent_id | INTEGER | Reference to the consent this record relates to |
| record_type | consent_record_type | Type of record using PostgreSQL enum type |
| record_type_detail | VARCHAR(100) | Additional context for custom record types |
| content | JSONB | Details of what happened (e.g., form data) |
| ip_address | INET | IP address associated with this specific record |
| record_metadata | JSONB | Additional context about the record (UI version, device info) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the record was created |

### Consent Audit Logs

```sql
CREATE TABLE consent_audit_logs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID,
  resource_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  resource_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  actor VARCHAR(100),
  changes JSONB,
  device_info TEXT,
  ip_address INET,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `consent_audit_logs` table provides a comprehensive audit trail of all consent-related operations. The `device_info` field stores information about the device used for the action, typically the user agent string from the browser or application.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| timestamp | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the audited action occurred |
| action | VARCHAR(50) | Type of action performed (e.g., 'create_consent', 'update_preferences', 'withdraw_consent') |
| user_id | UUID | User ID associated with this action, if applicable |
| resource_type | VARCHAR(50) | Type of resource being modified (e.g., 'consents', 'users') |
| resource_id | VARCHAR(100) | Identifier of the specific resource being modified |
| actor | VARCHAR(100) | Entity performing the action (user identifier or system name) |
| changes | JSONB | JSON object showing before/after states |
| device_info | TEXT | Information about the device used for this action |
| ip_address | INET | IP address associated with the action |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the audit log was created |

## Supporting Tables

### Domains

```sql
CREATE TABLE domains (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  is_pattern BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  pattern_type VARCHAR(20),
  parent_domain_id INTEGER REFERENCES domains(id),
  description VARCHAR(255),
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `domains` table manages the websites or applications to which consent applies, supporting both exact domains and pattern matching with wildcards.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| domain | VARCHAR(255) | Domain name or pattern (e.g., 'example.com', '*.example.com') |
| is_pattern | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if the domain is a pattern with wildcards |
| pattern_type | VARCHAR(20) | Type of pattern ('wildcard', 'regex') if isPattern is true |
| parent_domain_id | INTEGER | Reference to parent domain for hierarchical relationships |
| description | VARCHAR(255) | Optional description of this domain |
| is_active | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this domain is currently active |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the domain was created |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the domain was last updated |

### Consent Policies

```sql
CREATE TABLE consent_policies (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  version VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  effective_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  expiration_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `consent_policies` table stores the version history of privacy policies, allowing the system to track which policy version a user consented to.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| version | VARCHAR(20) | Version identifier of the policy (e.g., '1.0', '2023-01') |
| name | VARCHAR(100) | Human-readable name of the policy |
| effective_date | TIMESTAMPTZ | When this policy version became effective |
| expiration_date | TIMESTAMPTZ | Optional when this policy version expires |
| content | TEXT | Full text content of the policy |
| content_hash | VARCHAR(64) | Hash of the content for integrity verification |
| is_active | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this is the currently active policy |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the policy was created |

### Geographic Locations

```sql
CREATE TABLE geo_locations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  country_code VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL,
  country_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  region_code VARCHAR(5),
  region_name VARCHAR(100),
  regulatory_zones TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

The `geo_locations` table stores geographic information for regulatory compliance, mapping countries and regions to applicable privacy frameworks like GDPR or CCPA.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| country_code | VARCHAR(2) | ISO 2-letter country code (e.g., 'US', 'DE') |
| country_name | VARCHAR(100) | Full name of the country (e.g., 'United States', 'Germany') |
| region_code | VARCHAR(5) | Code for state/province/region within the country |
| region_name | VARCHAR(100) | Name of state/province/region |
| regulatory_zones | TEXT[] | Native PostgreSQL text array of applicable regulatory frameworks |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the location record was created |

## Junction Tables

### Consent Purpose Junction

The `consent_purpose_junction` table maps specific purposes to consent records.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| consent_id | INTEGER | Reference to the consent record |
| purpose_id | INTEGER | Reference to the purpose |
| is_accepted | BOOLEAN | Flag indicating if this specific purpose was accepted |

### Consent Geo Locations

The `consent_geo_locations` table links consent records to geographic locations.

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | SERIAL | Internal auto-incrementing primary key |
| consent_id | INTEGER | Reference to the consent record |
| geo_location_id | INTEGER | Reference to the geographic location |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | When the association was created |

## Data Integrity

The system maintains data integrity through:

1. **Foreign key relationships** with cascading deletions where appropriate
2. **Constraints** ensuring consent status consistency
3. **Triggers** that automatically:
   - Mark consents as inactive when withdrawn
   - Create audit log entries for key operations

For example, the following constraint ensures that withdrawn consents cannot be active:

```sql
ALTER TABLE consents ADD CONSTRAINT chk_consent_withdrawal_status 
  CHECK (
    (id NOT IN (SELECT consent_id FROM consent_withdrawals) AND is_active = true)
    OR
    (id IN (SELECT consent_id FROM consent_withdrawals) AND is_active = false)
  );
```

## Tracking Device Information

The system stores device information in two primary locations:

1. In the `consent_audit_logs` table's `device_info` field
2. In the `consentRecords` table's `recordMetadata` JSON field

The `device_info` field typically stores the user agent string, which contains information about the browser, operating system, and device:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1
```

For more detailed tracking, additional device information can be stored in a structured format in the `recordMetadata` field:

```json
{
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15...",
  "browserDetails": {
    "name": "Safari",
    "version": "15.0",
    "cookiesEnabled": true
  },
  "deviceDetails": {
    "type": "mobile",
    "model": "iPhone",
    "os": "iOS 15.0",
    "screenResolution": "390x844"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Querying Active Consent

To determine if a user has given valid consent:

```sql
SELECT * FROM consents 
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid' AND domain_id = 1 AND is_active = true;
```

### Recording Consent Withdrawal

When a user withdraws consent, create a record in the `consent_withdrawals` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO consent_withdrawals 
  (consent_id, revocation_reason, method, actor) 
VALUES 
  (123, 'User requested deletion of all data', 'web_form', 'user-self');
```

Database triggers will automatically:
1. Set the related consent to inactive
2. Create an audit log entry
3. Maintain the original consent record for compliance purposes

## Schema Relationships

The database schema defines relationships between tables:

- `users` ←→ `consents`: One-to-many (one user can have many consents)
- `domains` ←→ `consents`: One-to-many (one domain can have many consents)
- `consents` ←→ `consentRecords`: One-to-many (one consent can have many records)
- `consents` ←→ `consentPurposeJunction`: One-to-many
- `consents` ←→ `consentWithdrawals`: One-to-many
- `consentPurposes` ←→ `consentPurposeJunction`: One-to-many
- `geoLocations` ←→ `consentGeoLocations`: One-to-many
- `consents` ←→ `consentGeoLocations`: One-to-many
- `domains`: Self-referential for parent/child relationships

These relationships ensure data integrity and enable complex queries across the system.

## API Routes for Database Operations

The consent management system provides several API endpoints for interacting with the database. These endpoints handle operations like retrieving, storing, and updating consent records.

When a withdrawal request is processed, the API performs these operations in a transaction:

1. Creates a new record in the `consentWithdrawals` table
2. Updates the related consent record to set `isActive = false`
3. Creates a new record in the `consentRecords` table with type 'withdrawal'
4. Adds an entry to the `consentAuditLogs` table with action 'withdraw_consent'

The transaction ensures that all operations succeed or fail together, maintaining data integrity.

## Database Input Flow

When consent data is submitted to the system, the following steps occur:

1. **Request Validation**: The API validates the incoming data against expected schema
2. **Domain Resolution**: The system resolves the domain string to a domain ID from the domains table
3. **User Management**:
   - If the user exists (by UUID), the system uses the existing user record
   - If the user doesn't exist, a new user record is created
4. **Consent Record Creation**:
   - A new record is inserted into the `consents` table
   - Preferences are stored in the JSON preferences field
   - IP address and region information are captured
5. **Evidence Recording**:
   - A record is added to `consentRecords` with type 'form_submission'
   - Device info is stored in the recordMetadata field
6. **Audit Logging**:
   - The action is logged in `consentAuditLogs` with action type 'create_consent'

### Device Information Capture

During the consent recording process, device information is automatically captured:

```typescript
// Example of how device info is extracted from the request
const deviceInfo = req.headers['user-agent'];

// Information is stored in the audit log
await db.insert(consentAuditLogs).values({
  action: 'create_consent',
  userId: user.userId,
  resourceType: 'consents',
  resourceId: consentId.toString(),
  actor: 'user-self',
  deviceInfo,
  ipAddress: req.ip,
});
```

## Error Handling

API routes implement standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Consent record not found",
    "details": {
      "userId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "domain": "example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

Common error codes include:
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid request data
- `NOT_FOUND`: Requested resource not found
- `CONFLICT`: Operation would create a conflict
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server-side error

## Integration Examples

### Recording Consent from a Web Application

```javascript
async function recordConsent(userId, consentChoices) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/set-consent', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId,
      domain: window.location.hostname,
      preferences: consentChoices,
      metadata: {
        source: 'cookie_banner',
        version: '1.0',
      },
      policyVersion: '2023-05',
    }),
  });
  
  return await response.json();
}
```

### Checking Consent Status

```javascript
async function checkConsent(userId) {
  const domain = window.location.hostname;
  const response = await fetch(`/api/get-consent?userId=${userId}&domain=${domain}`);
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.success) {
    return result.data.preferences;
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

### Retrieving Consent History

```javascript
async function getConsentHistory(userId, options = {}) {
  const { domain, limit = 100, offset = 0 } = options;
  
  // Build the query string
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    userId,
    ...(domain && { domain }),
    limit: limit.toString(),
    offset: offset.toString(),
  });
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/get-consent-history?${params.toString()}`);
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (result.success) {
    return result.data;
  }
  
  throw new Error(result.error?.message || 'Failed to retrieve consent history');
}

// Example usage in a privacy dashboard
async function loadUserConsentHistory(userId) {
  try {
    const history = await getConsentHistory(userId);
    
    // Process all consents
    const consentCards = history.consents.map(consent => {
      const status = consent.isActive ? 'Active' : 'Withdrawn';
      const statusClass = consent.isActive ? 'status-active' : 'status-withdrawn';
      
      return `
        <div class="consent-card">
          <h3>${consent.domain}</h3>

          </div>
        </div>
      `;
    });
    
    // Update the dashboard UI
    document.getElementById('consent-history').innerHTML = consentCards.join('');
    
    // Add the audit log timeline
    renderAuditTimeline(history.auditLogs);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load consent history:', error);
    showErrorMessage('Could not load consent history. Please try again later.');
