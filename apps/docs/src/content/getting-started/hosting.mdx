title: Hosting Options
description: "c15t offers two main options for hosting the backend: using Consent.io's managed service or self-hosting your own instance."
---

## Using Consent.io (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with c15t is to use Consent.io's managed service. This option provides:

- Zero maintenance overhead
- Automatic updates and security patches
- High availability and scalability
- Built-in monitoring and analytics

### Setup Steps

<Steps>
<Step>
Create an account on [Consent.io](https://consent.io/dashboard)
</Step>

<Step>
Create a new instance in your dashboard

</Step>

<Step>
Copy the provided instance URL

![Instance Details](/content/getting-started/hosting/instance-details.png) 

</Step>

<Step>
Initialize your c15t client with the URL:

```typescript
'use client';
import { ConsentManagerProvider, createConsentClient } from '@c15t/react';

const client = createConsentClient({
  backendURL: 'https://your-instance.consent.dev/',
  // ... other configuration options
});

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <ConsentManagerProvider client={client}>
          {children}
        </ConsentManagerProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
	);
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Self-Hosting

For organizations that need complete control over their data or have specific compliance requirements, c15t supports self-hosting.

### Setup Steps

1. Install the backend package:
```bash
npm install @c15t/backend
```

2. Create a server instance:
```typescript
import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/backend';
import { kyselyAdapter } from '@c15t/backend/db/adapters/kysely';

const instance = c15tInstance({
  baseURL: 'https://your-domain.com',
  database: kyselyAdapter({
    dialect: 'postgres',
    connection: {
      host: process.env.DB_HOST,
      port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT || '5432'),
      database: process.env.DB_NAME,
      user: process.env.DB_USER,
      password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    },
  }),
});
```

3. Set up your client to use your self-hosted backend:
```typescript
import { c15tInstance } from '@c15t/react';

const instance = c15tInstance({
  backendURL: 'https://your-domain.com/api/c15t',
  // ... other configuration options
});
```

### Database Options

The backend supports multiple database adapters:

- **Kysely**: Type-safe SQL query builder (recommended for production)
- **Prisma**: Full-featured ORM with migrations
- **Drizzle**: Lightweight SQL ORM
- **Memory**: In-memory storage (for development/testing only)

## Comparing Options

| Feature | Consent.io | Self-Hosted |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Setup Complexity | Low | High |
| Maintenance | Low | Required |
| Control | Limited | Full |
| Updates | Managed | Manual |
| Cost | Plan-based | Infrastructure costs |
| Compliance | Standard | Customizable |

Choose the option that best fits your organization's needs, considering factors like:

- Technical expertise available
- Data sovereignty requirements
- Compliance needs
- Budget constraints
- Scalability requirements
