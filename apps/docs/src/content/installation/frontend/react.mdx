## Why @c15t/react?

Building privacy-compliant interfaces isn't just about showing a cookie banner - it's about managing user consent, respecting privacy choices, and maintaining detailed records. We've packaged all of this complexity into simple, customizable components that:

- **Just work out of the box** - Drop our components in and get instant privacy compliance
- **Look and feel native** - Seamlessly match your application's design
- **Handle the legal stuff** - Built-in support for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- **Manage consent automatically** - Smart state management that remembers user preferences
- **Stay up to date** - Automatic updates when regulations change

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install the package:

```package-install
@c15t/react
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Initialize the consent client:

```tsx title="lib/c15t-client.ts"
import { createConsentClient } from '@c15t/react';

const client = createConsentClient({
  backendURL: 'https://your-instance.c15t.dev/',
  // ... other configuration options
});
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add the privacy banner to your app:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import {
	ConsentManagerDialog,
	ConsentManagerProvider,
	CookieBanner,
} from "@c15t/react";
import { c15tClient } from './lib/c15t-client';

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider client={c15tClient}>
      <CookieBanner />
      <ConsentManagerDialog />
      {children}
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  )
}
```
</Step>
