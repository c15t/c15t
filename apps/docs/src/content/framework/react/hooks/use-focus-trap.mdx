import UseFocusTrapExample from '~/examples/react/use-focus-trap';

The `useFocusTrap` hook creates an accessible experience by preventing keyboard focus from leaving a specific container element (like a dialog or modal) until it's dismissed. This is essential for users navigating with keyboards or screen readers.

## Usage

This example shows how to implement focus trapping in a simple modal component:

<UseFocusTrapExample/>

## Parameters

The hook accepts two parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| shouldTrap | boolean | Controls whether focus should be trapped within the container |
| containerRef | RefObject\<HTMLElement\> \| null | Reference to the DOM element that should contain the focus |

## Returns

This hook doesn't return any values. It works by managing the focus behavior of the DOM through side effects.

## How It Works

When activated, the `useFocusTrap` hook:

1. Stores the element that was focused before trapping began
2. Finds all focusable elements within the container
3. Sets initial focus to the first focusable element (or the container itself)
4. Captures Tab and Shift+Tab keystrokes to cycle focus within the container
5. Restores focus to the original element when the component unmounts or `shouldTrap` becomes false

## Notes

- Hook must be called with a valid element reference that contains focusable elements
- Adding `tabIndex={0}` to the container ensures it can receive focus if no focusable children exist
- Always include proper ARIA attributes (`role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`) for screen reader accessibility
- The hook automatically restores focus to the previously focused element when the component unmounts
- Set `shouldTrap` to false when you want to disable focus trapping temporarily

## Accessibility Compliance

Using this hook helps your application comply with these WCAG 2.1 requirements:

- [2.1.2: No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html) - While this criterion warns against trapping keyboard focus, modal dialogs are an exception when implemented properly
- [2.4.3: Focus Order](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html) - Ensures focus moves in a meaningful sequence

## Usage with C15t Components

Many C15t components like `CookieBannerCard` and `ConsentManagerDialog` use this hook internally, so you don't need to implement it yourself when using these components. The `trapFocus` prop can be used to control this behavior:

```tsx
// The dialog will automatically trap focus when open
<ConsentManagerDialog trapFocus={true} />

// Focus trapping can be disabled if needed
<CookieBannerCard trapFocus={false}>
  {/* Content */}
</CookieBannerCard>
```

## Implementation Example

Here's how focus trapping is implemented in the `CookieBannerCard` component:

```tsx
const CookieBannerCard = forwardRef(({ children, ...props }, ref) => {
  const { trapFocus } = useTheme();
  const localRef = useRef(null);
  const cardRef = (ref || localRef);
  
  // Convert to boolean and enable focus trapping
  const shouldTrapFocus = Boolean(trapFocus);
  useFocusTrap(shouldTrapFocus, cardRef);
  
  return (
    <Box
      ref={ref}
      tabIndex={0}
      aria-modal={shouldTrapFocus ? 'true' : undefined}
      role={shouldTrapFocus ? 'dialog' : undefined}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </Box>
  );
});
```
