## Why @c15t/react?

Building privacy-compliant interfaces isn't just about showing a cookie banner - it's about managing user consent, respecting privacy choices, and maintaining detailed records. We've packaged all of this complexity into simple, customizable components that:

- **Just work out of the box** - Drop our components in and get instant privacy compliance
- **Look and feel native** - Seamlessly match your application's design
- **Handle the legal stuff** - Built-in support for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- **Manage consent automatically** - Smart state management that remembers user preferences
- **Stay up to date** - Automatic updates when regulations change
